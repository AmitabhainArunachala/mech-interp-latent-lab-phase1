Built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World's Fair, it's an engineering marvel with 7,300 iron components and 300,000 rivets. The tower's height, originally standing at 324 meters, has been surpassed by many modern structures, yet it remains the most recognizable monument in Paris. The Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination, welcoming nearly 7 million visitors annually. It offers panoramic views of the city, as well as unique experiences such as dining at the 58 Tour Eiffel restaurant. The tower's third-floor observation deck provides a breathtaking view of the Seine River, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and Montmartre.
