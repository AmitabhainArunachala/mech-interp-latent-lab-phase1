# Function Vectors – Todd et al., ICLR 2024

- **Title**: Function Vectors in Large Language Models
- **Why relevant**: Introduces "mode" or function vectors that encode *how* to process, not content; directly analogous to your recursive mode.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Difference-of-means function vector extraction.
  - Adding function vectors at inference to steer modes.
