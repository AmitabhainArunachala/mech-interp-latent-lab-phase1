# Causal Scrubbing – Chan et al., 2022

- **Title**: Causal Scrubbing: A Method for Rigorously Testing Interpretability Hypotheses
- **Why relevant**: Provides a rigorous test of circuit hypotheses (e.g., "late KV cache mediates recursive behaviour").
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Resample non-hypothesis activations while preserving statistics.
  - Measure behaviour and KL divergence under scrubbing.
- **Notes**: Use to formalise H_A vs H_B about KV vs R_V.
