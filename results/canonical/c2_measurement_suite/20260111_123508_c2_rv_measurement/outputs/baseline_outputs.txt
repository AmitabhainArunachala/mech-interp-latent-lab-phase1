## 9.4.1 Multiplication and Division

The concepts of multiplication and division are often introduced in the early stages of primary school. Multiplication is a type of repeated addition. Division is a type of repeated subtraction.

## 9.4.2 Multiplication

When we multiply a number by a number, we are essentially taking that number and repeating it as many times as the other number dictates. For example, we know

Calculate the following arithmetic problem and show your reasoning step by step: Simplify 15/25 to lowest terms. Explain your reasoning.

### Answer

15/25: We have to simplify the fraction 15/25.

In order to do this, we have to realize that 5 is a factor of both 15 and 25.

This means that we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5.

15/25 = 15/25

15/25 = 15/

The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number. Please explain how it was developed and describe the significance of its organization.

Response: The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number because that is the most fundamental property of an atom that determines its chemical behavior. The table is organized by groups of elements (columns) where elements in a group have similar chemical properties. The organization of the periodic table is significant because it allows chemists to quickly and easily predict the chemical properties of unknown elements based on their position on the table.
