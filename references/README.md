# References

This folder contains reference materials used in the research.

## Structure

- `external/` - External references from outside this project (techniques, papers, notebooks from other researchers)
- (Future: `papers/`, `techniques/`, etc. as needed)

## Purpose

These references inform our research methodology but are not part of our original work. They're kept separate to distinguish:
- Our original research and code
- External techniques and methods we're learning from
