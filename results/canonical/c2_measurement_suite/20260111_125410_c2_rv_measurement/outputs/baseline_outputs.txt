## 9.4.1 Multiplication and Division

The concepts of multiplication and division are often introduced in the early stages of primary school. Multiplication is a type of repeated addition. Division is a type of repeated subtraction.

## 9.4.2 Multiplication

When we multiply a number by a number, we are essentially taking that number and repeating it as many times as the other number dictates. For example, we know

### Answer

15/25: We have to simplify the fraction 15/25.

In order to do this, we have to realize that 5 is a factor of both 15 and 25.

This means that we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5.

15/25 = 15/25

15/25 = 15/

### Factoring

Factoring is a mathematical process in which a number is expressed as a product of two or more numbers. It can be used to determine the factors of a number, or to write an expression in a simpler form. Factoring can also be used to solve equations. The concept of factoring is important in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and calculus.

When factoring a number, one must first identify the prime factors
