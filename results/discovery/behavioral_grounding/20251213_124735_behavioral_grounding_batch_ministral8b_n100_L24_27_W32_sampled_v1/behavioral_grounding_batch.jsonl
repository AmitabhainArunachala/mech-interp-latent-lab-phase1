The Use of Rhetorical Devices\n\nIn the previous ten chapters we have examined the basic principles of the art of writing, and how their application to a particular context can produce more effective and efficient writing. In this chapter we discuss the use of rhetorical devices in order to create, embellish, or clarify written texts.\n\nThe most common rhetorical devices are:\n\n- repetition\n- parallelism\n- metaphor and simile\n- personification\n- alliteration\n- assonance\n- onomatopoeia\n- hy", "metrics": {"self_ref_rate": 0.0, "unique_word_ratio": 0.7183098591549296, "repeat_4gram_frac": 0.08823529411764706, "gen_chars": 508, "gen_token_count": 120}}
