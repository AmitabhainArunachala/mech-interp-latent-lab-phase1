# Induction Heads & KV Cache – Olsson et al., 2022

- **Title**: In-Context Learning and Induction Heads
- **Why relevant**: Shows how KV cache and specific heads implement copy/induction; your recursive mode may sit on similar mechanisms.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Head-level induction scoring.
  - KV-cache swap experiments.
