Abstract
Language models often struggle with handling
factual knowledge, exhibiting factual hallucina-
tion issue. This makes it vital to evaluate the
models’ ability to recall its parametric knowl-
edge about facts. In this study, we introduce
a knowledge probing benchmark, BELIEF(-
ICL), to evaluate the knowledge recall ability
of both encoder- and decoder-based pre-trained
language models (PLMs) from diverse perspec-
tives. BELIEFs utilize a multi-prompt dataset
to evaluate PLM’s accuracy, consistency, and
reliability in factual knowledge recall. To en-
able a more reliable evaluation with BELIEFs,
we semi-automatically create MyriadLAMA,
which has massively diverse prompts. We vali-
date the effectiveness of BELIEFs in compre-
hensively evaluating PLM’s knowledge recall
ability on diverse PLMs, including recent large
language models (LLMs). We then investigate
key factors in memorizing and recalling facts
in PLMs, such as model size, pretraining strat-
egy and corpora, instruction-tuning process and
in-context learning settings. Finally, we reveal
the limitation of the prompt-based knowledge
probing. The MyriadLAMA is publicized.1

Introduction
One of the strongest motivations for training a
language model (LM) using massive text is to in-
crease the ability to handle factual knowledge (Ka-
malloo et al., 2023). However, even if LMs are
trained on massive text, they suffer from hallucina-
tions that generate incorrect knowledge-grounded
sentences (Zhang et al., 2023). Considering that
large LMs (LLMs) are being widely applied to real-
world tasks, it is vital to evaluate the ability to recall
the LLMs’ parametric knowledge and what factors
influence on memorizing facts during pre-training.

Figure 1: BELIEFs with MyriadLAMA: the BELIEF
benchmarks utilize diverse factual prompts (here, Myr-
iadLAMA) to assess LM’s knowledge recall ability in
terms of accuracy, consistency, and reliability.
However, evaluating the LLM’s knowledge re-
call ability is still challenging. Although LAMA
probe (Petroni et al., 2019) evaluates the knowl-
edge stored in pre-trained LMs (PLMs), it provides
only prediction accuracy. Some studies diversify
prompts in the LAMA probe to compute prediction
consistency (robustness) (Elazar et al., 2021; Jiang
et al., 2020), but those datasets have either low qual-
ity or low quantity issues (§B). Moreover, since the
LAMA probe assumes encoder-based PLMs with
the masked LM objective to solve fill-in-the-blank
tasks, directly applying it to decoder-based LLMs
will underestimate their knowledge recall ability.
Although recent studies leveraged QA datasets to
probe LLMs’ knowledge (Kalo and Fichtel, 2022;
Mallen et al., 2023; Wiland et al., 2024; Maekawa
et al., 2024), they overlook other important aspects
than prediction accuracy such as robustness to di-
verse prompts and the reliability of predictions,
which are important for real-world applications.
In this study, we introduce a multifaceted bench-
mark for knowledge probing, BELIEFs (Figure 1),
including BELIEF (§2) and BELIEF-ICL (§3) for
encoder- and decoder-based PLMs. BELIEFs uti-
lize diverse prompts for each fact to account for
the impact of linguistic expressions when evalu-

ating LLMs’ knowledge recall ability. This al-
lows us to evaluate the robustness and reliabil-
ity of LLM knowledge by measuring fluctuations
in accuracy, consistency, and overconfidence in
fact prediction. Since BELIEFs require a multi-
prompt probing dataset with diverse prompts for
each fact, we build a new probing dataset, Myri-
adLAMA, to enable a more accurate and compre-
hensive evaluation (§4). MyriadLAMA expands
LAMA-UHN (Petroni et al., 2020) by offering
different prompts for each fact through a semi-
automatic method. Specifically, we obtain a wide
variety of lexically, syntactically, and semantically
diverse prompts by rewriting relational templates
and extending subject expressions.
We applied BELIEFs to various encoder- and
decoder-based PLMs, including BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019) and Llama3 (Dubey et al., 2024) (§5.1).
Through extensive evaluations, we verify the utility
of BELIEFs in uncovering PLMs’ knowledge re-
call ability (§5). Moreover, by comparing different
PLMs, we gain insights into the factors affecting
knowledge recall of PLMs from three aspects: ac-
curacy, reliability and robustness (§6).
The primary findings in this study are as follows:
• Model size, pretraining strategy, and corpora
are crucial factors for memorizing knowledge
in LMs during pretraining.
• Whereas instruction-tuning enhances LLMs’
ability to follow instructions in BELIEF-ICL,
it reduces their knowledge recall ability.
• The inclusion and selection of demonstrations
impact knowledge recall, revealing the gap
between memorized and recallable facts.
• Exploring the upper limits of covered knowl-
edge by various methods reveals the limitation
of prompt-based knowledge probing (§7).

BELIEF Benchmark
We first present the multifaceted factual probing
benchmark, BELIEF for encoder-based PLMs. Us-
ing a multi-prompt probing dataset, BELIEF evalu-
ates the knowledge recall ability of PLMs from ac-
curacy, robustness and reliability (§2.2-2.4). Here,
robustness measures PLMs’ ability to maintain con-
sistent accuracy and predictions when given differ-
ent prompts in evaluation. Reliability reflects the
extent to which we can trust the PLMs’ predictions.
2.1
Preliminaries
To evaluate the facts in PLMs, BELIEF aggre-
gates results from multiple prompts for each fact
to mitigate biases from specific linguistic expres-
sions. This requires varied expressions for each
fact, namely multi-prompt factual probing dataset.
We assume the fill-in-the-blank settings, where
each fact is represented as a knowledge triple
⟨subject, relation, object⟩(e.g., ⟨Tokyo, Capital,
Japan⟩). To probe PLMs for a knowledge triple, we
first create a masked prompt (hereafter, prompt)
(e.g., “Tokyo is the capital of [Y]”) for it and then
input it into PLMs to see if they correctly predict
the object token. To create such prompts, we first
need a template for the relation (hereafter, rela-
tional template, e.g., [X] is the capital of [Y]).
We then fill the template with target knowledge
triples, replacing [X] with a subject expression and
[Y] with a [MASK] token. A multi-prompt dataset
offers diverse prompts for each fact by providing
varied relational templates and entity expressions.
We denote the subject-relation pairs in dataset
as T, the set of prompts for a given subject-relation
pair t ∈T as Pt. If the output distribution cor-
responding to mask token of a prompt is O =
{(wj, oj)| P
j oj = 1}, the prediction result is de-
fined as the token ˆw = argmaxwj,(wj,oj)∈Ooj.
2.2
Accuracy and its fluctuations
To correctly evaluate the accuracy of PLMs, we ag-
gregate predictions from diverse prompts. Specif-
ically, we randomly select one prompt for each
subject-relation pair t ∈T to form a set of prompts
for all triples P = {p1, ..., p|T|}. By feeding these
prompts P to PLMs, we can calculate one accuracy
value based on their predictions. We repeat this
process to collect a set of accuracies, which we
then use to calculate both average and fluctuation.
Average accuracy:
In BELIEF, accuracy met-
rics include Acc@1, which measures the rate of
prompts with the correct token predicted within the
top-1 output probabilities. Then we repeat this pro-
cess N times to obtain a set of accuracies, denoted
as VAcc@1, where |VAcc@1| = N. The final average
accuracy is calculated as the mean value of VAcc@1.
Fluctuation of accuracy: For VAcc@1, we evalu-
ate accuracy fluctuations using the range and stan-
dard deviation (SD). The range is determined by
the difference between the maximum and minimum
accuracy values in VAcc@1.
2.3
Consistency
For each subject-relation pair t, we assess the
PLM’s consistency in predicting the object across
different prompts in Pt. Specifically, we compute
the degree of match between the prediction result
ˆwi
t for a given prompt pi
t and the prediction results
ˆwj
t for other prompts pj
t ∈Pt (where j ̸= i), across
all subject-relation pairs in T:

Reliability
The reliability of PLMs reflects the extent to which
we can trust the predictions they provide. In our
study, we measure PLMs’ overconfidence level in
making fact prediction, drawing from the expected
error calibration metric (Desai and Durrett, 2020).
Specially, we measure the difference between true
prediction accuracy and models’ confidence to their
predicted tokens. For each prompt, we first ac-
quire the maximum probability (hereafter, confi-
dence) from the output distribution for the mask
token. Subsequently, all of the prompts are ar-
ranged in descending order based on confidence
and segmented into M bins (P (1), P (2), ..., P (M)),
with the same amount of data points in each bin.
For each bin i, we compute the average accuracy
Acc@1
(i) and average confidence omax(i). In our
work, we use M = 10 for all the experiments. Fi-
nally, the PLM’s overconfidence in predicting the
object is assessed by averaging differences between
average confidence and accuracy across all bins:
Ovconf =
M
X
i=1
|P (i)|
M
(omax(i) −Acc@1
(i))
(2)
The closer the Ovconf is to zero, the more
aligned the model’s confidence is with its accu-
racy, indicating reliable confidence. A negative
Ovconf value means the model is underconfident.

BELIEF-ICL for Decoder-based LLMs
Recent LLMs are based on decoder-only Trans-
former architecture, and are trained to predict sub-
sequent tokens in a sequence. This makes it chal-
lenging for them to directly predict [MASK] tokens
in masked prompts, as they cannot utilize informa-
tion following the [MASK] (e.g., “[MASK] and
Tokyo are twin cities”). To comprehensively eval-
uate LLMs and enable fair comparison between
encoder- and decoder-based models, we extend BE-
LIEF to LLMs by employing in-context learning
(ICL), termed BELIEF-ICL.
3.1
In-context learning for fact probe
The in-context learning ability allows LLMs to per-
form complex tasks during inference using task-
specific prompts (Brown et al., 2020). When de-
signing ICL for evaluating factual knowledge, it is
essential to consider task instructions and context
examples appended to the target prompts.
1) Task instruction: We introduce the mask predic-
tion (MP) instruction for prompting LLMs generat-
ing one word answer for the target masked prompt.
The task instruction is formulated as “Predict the
[MASK] in each sentence in one word.”.
2) Context settings: We propose four types of con-
texts to assess the impact of examplar selection on
factual knowledge probing, following the QA for-
mat outlined in InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022).
zero-shot uses only instructions; X-random sam-
ples X facts from all relations as the few-shot
demonstrations; X-relation samples X facts from
the same relation but with random templates; X-
template samples X facts from the same relations
and the same template.
In the few-shot learning settings, we ensure that
the target fact is excluded in the examples. Refer
to §E for examples of prompts.
3.2
Evaluation methods
Since LLMs generate responses without a token
limit, matching the correct answer with the model’s
output can be challenging. Variations in language
expressions, such as the presence or absence of ar-
ticles and singular or plural forms, complicate this
process. Additionally, the model may generate ex-
tra tokens not relevant to the [MASK] token, such
as parts of the prompt. For example, for the prompt
“John Lennon can play [MASK],” both “guitars”
and “a guitar” should be considered correct.
To measure BELIEF metrics for LLMs, we com-
pare two strings: the generated text and the correct
object expression for Acc@1, and two generated
texts for Consist and Ovconf. Here, we first nor-
malize strings by tokenizing and lemmatizing them.
For example, “a guitar” and “guitars” are normal-
ized to “a, guitar” and “guitar.” If a normalized
string list is included in the other (partial match-
ing), they are considered matched.
1) Accuracy and its fluctuations: Accuracy is
calculated by comparing the string generated by
the model using a greedy decoding strategy to the
correct answers. Notably, the matching judgment is
one-directional: it only checks if the correct answer
is included in the generated string. One-directional
matching is adopted to avoid incorrect judgments
from the model generating unrelated words. We use
the same N as in §2.2 for accuracy measurement.
2) Consistency: We use bi-directional matching
to evaluate the consistency (Consist) of generated
sequences from two prompts.
3) Reliability: To calculate overconfidence, we
need the model’s confidence (probability) in its out-
put. However, we cannot obtain this directly from
the probability over generated tokens, as LLMs can
produce diverse outputs that represent the same an-
swer. To address this, we propose an approximate
measurement. For each prompt, we generate 100
samples using multinomial sampling2. We then
measure the matching rate between the output gen-
erated from greedy decoding and the outputs from
the 100 samples. This matching rate serves as the
confidence value for the prompt3. The calculation
of Ovconf follows the same setting in §2.4. This
method can approximate the BELIEF’s Ovconf cal-
culation as BELIEF sampling answers from the
output distribution. Note that, due to the high cost
of generating 100 samples for each fact, we adopt a
more efficient approach. We sample 10K prompts
from 10K unique subject-relation pairs and only
use these 10K prompts for answer sampling.

MyriadLAMA Dataset
The fairness and accuracy of BELIEF evalua-
tion depend on the diversity and quality of multi-
prompt factual probing datasets. However, existing
datasets are either manually rewritten in small num-
bers (Elazar et al., 2021) or mined from texts (Jiang
et al., 2020). The former is accurate but lacks diver-
sity, providing an average of 7.3 prompts per fact
with limited variation. For example, templates like
“[X] works as [Y]” and “[X], who works as [Y]”
are provided as different templates but very similar.
2Multinomial sampling selects a next token according to
the probability, over the entire vocabulary given by the model.
3This method can approximate the overconfidence calcu-
lation in BELIEF of sampling answers from the output dis-
tribution. It makes the confidence calculated by BELIEF for
encoder-based models comparable to that in BELIEF-ICL.
Additionally, the number of templates is highly im-
balanced, with 8 out of 46 relations having only one
template, while P1384 has 20. The latter is diverse
but includes templates that do not necessarily im-
ply the relationship. For instance, for relation P937
(work location)5, the mined templates include “[X]
to meet [Y].,” which significantly deviates from
the original meaning. To achieve a more accurate
and fair evaluation, we introduce MyriadLAMA,
a new multi-prompt factual probing dataset with
improved diversity while retaining quality. Refer to
§B for detailed qualitative and quantitative compar-
isons between MyriadLAMA and prior datasets.
4.1
Dataset construction
We build MyriadLAMA by semi-automatically ex-
tending the existing single-prompt probing dataset
LAMA-UHN (Petroni et al., 2020). MyriadLAMA
generates multiple prompts for each fact by pro-
viding multiple, equal relational templates for each
relation and varying the linguistic expressions of
subjects. Additionally, MyriadLAMA offers mul-
tiple expressions for each object to cover missed
facts that are correctly predicted but in different
tokens. For example, for the query “John Lennon
was born in [MASK]”, acceptable tokens could
include “UK” and “Britain.”6
Specifically, we define knowledge triples that ne-
glect the diversity of surface expressions as unique
triples and distinguish them from derived triples,
which embody the diverse entity expressions and re-
lational templates in each unique triple. The triple
extension methods are described below.
Extending entities: The knowledge triples in
LAMA-UHN constitute a subset of the Wikipedia
knowledge base T-REx (Elsahar et al., 2018). T-
REx selectively includes only certain objects for
subject-relation pairs. MyriadLAMA extends the
unique triples in LAMA-UHN by mining T-REx
using subject-relation as key to include other avail-
able objects. For example, if LAMA-UHN contains
only E_{guitar} for instruments that “John Lennon”
can play, we can extend the unique triple to include
E_{piano}. We also extend the entity expressions
using aliases obtained from Wikidata.7

5https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P937
6We follow the setting of LAMA-UHN triples where the
object is a single token according to the BERT tokenizer.
During evaluation, we consider the fact to be present, if the
model’s predicted token matches any of the correct tokens,
regardless of which correct answer is predicted.

Paraphrasing relational templates:
Myriad-
LAMA creates a great variety of relational tem-
plates by a semi-automatic process. Firstly, we
manually generate five distinct templates for each
relation. They incorporate entailment expressions
and diverse syntactic patterns like statements and
question-answer formats to provide semantic and
syntactic variations. Next, to enhance quantity and
lexical diversity, we automatically paraphrase each
manually created template 19 times using the GPT-
4 API.8 Finally, all templates are filtered by human
reviewers to remove low quality templates, yielding
a total of 4100 templates covering 41 relations.
4.2
Dataset Statistics
Table 1 lists the statistics of MyriadLAMA. The
number of derived triples is increased from 27,106
in LAMA-UHN to 21,140,500, by combining var-
ious semi-automatically generated relational tem-
plates and the alias expressions for subject and
object entities. As the prompts are generated from
derived triples without considering the object ex-
pressions, the number of generated prompts are
less than the number of derived triples, which is
increased from 24,643 to 6,492,800. Refer to the
appendices for details on dataset construction (§A)
and validity analysis of MyriadLAMA (§C). Exam-
ples of extended templates are provided in §A.3.

pretraining information are listed in Table 2. Refer
to §F for more details.
We conduct a full-scale evaluation on LLMs
with up to 8 billion parameters.
To save cost
of LLM inference, we use five manually rewrit-
ten templates only for the LLMs with more than
8B parameters, including Llama2-70B and its IT
variant Llama2-70B-IT, Llama3-70B, and Phi3-
medium.10 To calculate the average and fluctuation
of accuracy (§2.2), we set a large sample number
(N = 50, 000) to provide stable, accurate result.
In the following sections, we analyze the evalua-
tion results on various PLMs to deepen our under-
standing of how PLMs learn and represent factual
knowledge. All evaluation results, including those
for another family of encoder-based models, AL-
BERT, are presented in Section §F.3.

mance across different model sizes.

5.2
Do BELIEFs provide additional insights?
BELIEFs offer evaluation from diverse perspec-
tives rather than accuracy. As shown in Table 3
(Above), the evaluation result highlights accu-
racy fluctuations among the BERT variants. All
BERT models show low consistency and tend to be
overconfident in their predictions. Figure 2 (left)
depicts the relationship between confidence and
Acc@1 of the BERT models, indicating low ac-
curacy even for prompts with confident outputs.
Whereas BERTwwm performs better over most BE-
LIEF metrics, BERTlarge outperforms BERTwwm
on LAMA-UHN. This discrepancy arises from the
limited prompts used in LAMA-UHN and the the
single-faceted evaluation method. This highlights
BELIEF’s effectiveness in achieving a more accu-
rate factual probing comparison between PLMs.
5.3
Does ICL adhere to instructions?
We then explore the effectiveness of different ICL
settings in extracting facts from LLMs. We evalu-
ate the instruction adherence of these settings from
two aspects: predicting facts and generating one-
word answers, reflecting that the target objects in
MyriadLAMA are primarily one-word entities.
Table 4 shows Acc@1 and one-word genera-
tion ratio of two pretrained LLMs (Llama2-7B and
Llama3-8B) and one instruction-tuned LLM (Phi3-
small). We found that under few-shot settings, even
the pretrained LLMs exhibit a remarkable ability to
follow instructions, indicating the effectiveness of
prompting LLMs to predict mask tokens through
in-context learning. Our evaluation with QA-style
ICL settings also confirms this (see §D for details).
Moreover, exemplars similar to the target prompt
(4-template) in the context boosted improvement
overall metrics (Table 3 Below, Table 4).

5.4
Can BELIEFs mitigate bias?
We explore whether BELIEFs can mitigate prompt
bias in evaluations. To measure prompt bias quan-
titatively, we use content-free prompts, where the
subject is replaced by meaningless tokens (Zhao
et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2024), and collect the proba-
bilities of candidate tokens in the output distribu-
tions over the mask token.12 We measure the bias
level of the prompt using the certainty of distribu-
tions over candidate tokens. Specifically, we define
bias level as follows:
bias-level = 1 −
H
Hmax
(3)
where H is the entropy, and Hmax is the maximum
entropy for the uniform distribution with same size.
We measure bias in both single- and multi-
prompt evaluations. In single-prompt evaluation,
we represent bias as the average level across all
relational templates. For measuring bias-level in
multi-prompt evaluation, we first average output

tion, then use the bias-level of the averaged distribu-
tion to quantify it. Taking P31:instance-of13 as an
example, the average probability of “science” over
all templates is 8.30%, but it rises to 52.79% for
template: “[Y] contains [X] as one of its elements.”

Differentiating PLMs in Fact Probing
This section compares the PLMs’ knowledge recall
abilities in terms of accuracy, reliability, and ro-
bustness and then explores factors affecting them.
6.1
Factors affecting the recall accuracy
1) Pre-training strategy. Table 3 confirms that
BERTwwm outperforms BERTlarge in terms of all
metrics, while BERTwwm differs from BERTlarge
12Specifically, we adopt a similar setting to (Zhao et al.,
2021), by ensembling the distribution over prompts with three
content-free tokens: “N/A,” an empty string, and “?”.

only in the masking strategy during pre-training.
The superiority of BERTwwm likely stems from
its challenging pre-training paradigm, which re-
quires recalling whole words without sub-token
information, enhancing word-level contextual un-
derstanding. This underscores the importance of
pre-training strategy in knowledge acquisition.
2) Model size. Table 5 compares the knowledge
recall abilities of LLMs with difference sizes.14 We
can observe that larger LLMs consistently achieve
higher accuracy in predicting facts. Combining
with the improvement from BERTbase to BERTlarge
from Table 3, the importance of model size in fact
acquisition during pre-training is confirmed.
3) Pre-training corpora.
Table 5 shows that
Llama3-8B outperforms larger Llama2-13B in fact
probing. This is likely due to Llama3’s pre-training
corpus being seven times larger than Llama2 (Ta-
ble 2). Meanwhile, Llama3-70B surpasses Llama2-
70B, confirming the importance of pre-training data
volume for fact acquisition.
In the zero-shot evaluation using the entire Myr-
iadLAMA, as shown in Table 6, Phi3-mini out-
performs Llama2-7B-IT and Llama3-8B in knowl-
14Owing to the high computational cost of inference on
large LLMs like Llama2-70B, we select only five manually
rewritten templates with 4-template ICL setting for evaluation.

edge retrieval. Given that Phi3-mini (3.8B) has
about half the model size of Llama2-7B-IT and
Llama3-8B-IT, and model size typically enhances
knowledge retrieval, this result is notable. This
superior performance can be attributed to the high-
quality, textbook-like material used for pre-training
the Phi3 models, highlighting the significant impact
of high-quality training data.
4) Instruction-tuning.
Table 7 confirms that
instruction-tuned Llama2-7B-IT exhibit a higher
one-word generation rate than Llama2-7B, as ex-
pected. However, the instruction-tuned LLM con-
sistently demonstrate lower Acc@1 scores on dif-
ferent ICL settings. This indicates a potential neg-
ative impact of instruction-tuning on the models,
where general language understanding can improve,
but some factual knowledge is partially lost as a
result of the tuning process.
5) Inclusion and selection of demonstrations. As
shown in Table 7 and Table 18, using demonstra-
tions in prompts consistently improves Acc@1. In-
cluding few-shot demonstrations with same tem-
plates to the target question can nearly double
Acc@1 values (from zero-shot to 4-template set-
tings). Closer demonstrations also enhance perfor-
mance across all metrics, highlighting a significant
gap between the factual knowledge LLMs memo-
rized and what they can actually recall.
6.2
Factors affecting the reliability
Table 3 shows a significant difference in Ovconf be-
tween BERT models and Llama3-8B, with BERT
models being overconfident and Llama3-8B being
underconfident. In this section, we explore the rea-
sons for these differences and investigate additional
factors affecting reliability beyond model size.
1) The number of output tokens. One main dif-
ference in Ovconf calculation between encoder-

Confidence

and decoder-based PLMs is that the decoder-based
PLMs will generate multiple tokens. Thus, we in-
vestigate the effect of output token count on Ovconf
values. We divide the MyriadLAMA prompt set
into groups based on the number of tokens gener-
ated. For each group, we calculate the probability
of the entire token sequence and compute Ovconf
for token counts from 1 to 5.15
The Ovconf values for each group of 1 to 5 out-
put tokens on Llama3-8B (4-template) are -0.1030,
-0.0906, -0.0297, -0.0546, and 0.0573, showing
models become more overconfident with more out-
put tokens. This trend is consistent across models.
2) Instruction-tuning inflates LLMs confidence.
Table 7 and Figure 3 confirm that instruction-tuned
LLMs make the models overly confident in their
outputs. The pretraining use more diverse language
data with uncertainties, which can lead to a more
calibrated output confidence. Instruction-tuning
narrow the LLMs’ exposure to specific tasks, re-
ducing its ability to express uncertainty and making
it more likely to provide overconfident outputs.
3) Model size: Large models consistently demon-
strate improved reliability, as illustrated in Table 5.
6.3
Factors affecting the robustness
1) Larger model cannot make zero-shot knowl-
edge prompt more robust. Similar to accuracy
and reliability, few-shot knowledge prompts show
improved robustness against accuracy fluctuations
and consistency as model size increases. However,
this effect is absent in zero-shot settings. For in-
stance, the SD for the Llama2 family are 0.2014,
0.2131, and 0.2126 for the 7B, 13B, and 70B mod-
els, respectively. Similar inconsistencies are ob-
served across other LLM families with varying
model sizes. Refer Table 18 for more details.
15The prompts generated within five tokens cover 98.78%
of Llama3-8B’s generations with the 4-template ICL setting.

and ICL settings. Each cell indicates the rate of facts
correctly predicted by the top-listed model relative to
those captured by the left-listed model.
2) Instruction-tuning making fluctuation less
influenced by context. Table 7 and Table 17 show
that the instruction-tuned models exhibit reduced
fluctuation (smaller range and SD) in the zero-shot,
4-random, and 4-relation ICL settings, but perform
worse in the 4-template setting. This suggests that
instruction-tuned models become less influenced
by context and more reliant on the instruction itself.
In contrast, the Consist measure consistently de-
creased in instruction-tuned models, suggesting
that while instruction-tuning improves instruction
interpretation, it may weaken semantic understand-
ing, especially with paraphrases.
6.4
How do PLMs perceive facts differently?
Finally, we measure the differences in fact cover-
age among models. We first collect the correctly
predicted facts for each template, defining these as
the model’s covered facts. Given the covered facts
of two models, we measure the knowledge shar-
ing rates using an asymmetric metric. This metric
calculates the proportion of shared facts relative to
each model’s total covered facts.
Figure 4 shows the results. The average shar-
ing rate among BERT models is 69.1%, while it
is 68.7% for Llama2-7B, Llama2-7B-IT, and Phi3-
mini in the zero-shot setting. In comparison, the
average sharing rate between encoder- and decoder-
based PLMs reduced to 47.1%. Meanwhile, knowl-
edge sharing rates in both zero-shot and 4-template
settings indicate that incorporating examples im-
proves the knowledge elicited by the PLMs. How-
ever, about 10% of knowledge can still only be

elicited in the zero-shot setting (see red boxes).

Limitation of Prompt-based Probing
Finally, we examine the limitation of prompt-based
knowledge probing by using our massively diverse
dataset. First, we gauge the average knowledge cov-
erage rate by using the average Acc@1 (average).
Next, for each relation, we calculate the maximum
Acc@1 using the template that yields the high-
est accuracy,16 and use this value to estimate the
upper limit of prompt-based knowledge probing
(maximum). Finally, we approximate the upper
limit of facts contained in LLMs, by considering
a fact as existing if at least one prompt of this fact
can produce the correct answer (oracle).
Table 8 shows three knowledge coverage rates
on some PLMs. For PLMs with zero-shot settings
(including BERTwwm), we observe nearly a 30%
increase between average and maximum accuracy,
emphasizing the importance of selecting suitable
templates for specific facts and the potential gains
from prompt engineering. This gap can be reduced
to 5% with few-shot settings. However, the gap
between maximum and oracle accuracy mostly re-
mains. This indicates that different facts prefer dif-
ferent templates, suggesting no versatile template
works for all facts. Combining templates reveals
the true upper limits of PLMs’ knowledge mem-
orization and highlights the importance of using
diverse prompts over optimizing a single one for
retrieval. Refer to §F.4 for results on more PLMs.

Related Work
The LAMA probe was first proposed to evaluate
the utility of PLMs as knowledge bases via solv-
ing the fill-in-the-blank task (Petroni et al., 2019).
16We select the prompt with the best subject expression
among prompts for each fact.
Several researchers extend the LAMA probe to
evaluate PLMs’ ability to understand facts from di-
verse linguistic aspects, such as the effect of nega-
tion/mispriming (Kassner and Schütze, 2020), dis-
tractors (Pandia and Ettinger, 2021), multilingual
understanding (Keleg and Magdy, 2023; Zhao et al.,
2024) and models’ consistency facing prompts with
minor nuances (Fierro and Søgaard, 2022; Elazar
et al., 2021). However, these studies lack the in-
spection of PLMs’ reliability in knowledge pre-
diction, which is vital in deploying LLMs to real-
world tasks. Moreover, solving the fill-in-the-blank
task by LLMs with the causal LM objective can
underestimate their knowledge recall ability.
Recently, QA-based datasets have been devel-
oped to evaluate the knowledge recall ability of
decoder-only LMs. Kalo and Fichtel (2022) cre-
ated a high-quality QA prompt set, which is further
extended by Wiland et al. (2024) to evaluate both
causal and masked LMs. Mallen et al. (2023) and
Maekawa et al. (2024) developed QA datasets to
see the impact of knowledge popularity and re-
trieval augmentation. Since the writing style of
these datasets is limited to questions, we cannot
perform reliable robustness evaluation.

Conclusions
This paper presents the multi-faceted factual prob-
ing benchmarks, BELIEF and BELIEF-ICL, for
encoder- and decoder-based PLMs, respectively.
Leveraging a multi-prompt dataset, BELIEFs pro-
vide various evaluation metrics, including accu-
racy, consistency, and reliability, enabling a thor-
ough evaluation of PLMs’ knowledge recall abil-
ities. To make BELIEFs more reliable, we build
a new multi-prompt dataset for knowledge prob-
ing, MyriadLAMA, featuring diverse prompts for
each fact. We conducted extensive experiments of
multiple encoder-based PLMs and recent LLMs.
Based on the evaluation results, we identify key
factors affecting the accuracy, reliability and robust-
ness of PLMs’ fact recall, such as model size, pre-
training strategy and corpora, and ICL settings. We
also reveal the negative effect of instruction-tuning
in recall factual knowledge from LLMs. This high-
lights the need for careful design of instruction-
tuning to preserve LLMs’ knowledge recall abili-
ties. Finally, by probing facts in different ways, we
find that PLMs hold more knowledge than what is
revealed by using the optimal template, highlight-
ing the limitations of prompt-based factual probing.
10
Limitations
MyriadLAMA contains an extensive amount of
prompts, which leads to high evaluation costs. In
the future, we aim to extract a diverse yet robust
subset from MyriadLAMA to enable a more effi-
cient evaluation of factual knowledge. Addition-
ally, MyriadLAMA is built upon LAMA-UHN,
which includes only 41 relationships. Expanding
the range of relations is essential to improve cover-
age in the evaluation of factual knowledge. Lastly,
we need to evaluate closed-source LLMs, such as
GPT-4 and Claude, to examine performance differ-
ences between them and open-source LLMs.

A
Construction of MyriadLAMA
In this appendix, we explain the detailed proce-
dure for generating the derived triples from unique
triples in MyriadLAMA. As discussed in §4, this
study first extends the unique triples contained in
LAMA-UHN (Petroni et al., 2020) by searching
new objects from T-REx (Elazar et al., 2021). Next,
for the obtained unique triples, we generate de-
rived triples by combining concrete linguistic ex-
pressions associated with entities (“subjects” and
objects) and diversify relational templates using
both manual labor and LLMs. We describe the
detailed procedure as following.
A.1
The extension of entities
Extension
of
unique
triples
from
T-REx
LAMA-UHN is a refined subset derived from the
LAMA dataset, which LAMA originates from T-
REx (Elsahar et al., 2018).
T-REx is a large-
scale knowledge base containing 11 million real-
world knowledge triples, aligned with 3.09 mil-
lion Wikipedia abstracts, designed to create large-
scale alignments between Wikipedia abstracts and
Wikidata triples. To achieve this alignment, T-REx
employed three distinct aligners—NoSub, AllEnt,
and SPO—each offering varying levels of accu-
racy (0.98, 0.96, and 0.88, respectively) as mea-
sured on a test set. Despite the high alignment
accuracy of all three aligners, LAMA-UHN selects
only the triples aligned by NoSub, the aligner with
the highest accuracy. While this choice ensures
the high correctness of triples within LAMA, it
potentially compromises the ability to fairly as-
sess a PLM’s knowledge recall ability, as it may
overlook valid answers during evaluation. To ad-
dress this limitation, we expand the MyriadLAMA
dataset by incorporating triples aligned by all three
aligners—NoSub, AllEnt, and SPO—found in T-
REx, based on the subject-relation pairs present
in LAMA-UHN. As the result, we increase the
number of unique triples from 27,106 to 34,048 as
shown in Table 1.
Extension of entities using aliases
Next, we uti-
lize aliases of entities obtained from Wikidata to
acquire diverse linguistic expressions (and their
paraphrases) for the “subjects” and objects. Specif-
ically, we used the Wikidata identifiers of entities17
and the Wikidata API18 to retrieve the (English)
alias expressions of entities. By combining the
aliases of “subjects” and objects with the relation
templates mentioned later, we generate numerous
new derived triples. If N “subjects” and M ob-
jects are given for an unique triple, the number of
derived triples according to this unique triple gen-
erated from a single relational template is N × M.
A.2
Diversification of relation templates
We use a two-step procedure to create new rela-
tional templates, to enhance ensure both the quality
and quantity. Initially, we manually rewrite rela-
tional templates, ensuring that every relation has
five templates. Then, we employ the generative
LLM (GPT4) to automatically paraphrase 19 addi-
tional templates. In total, we produce 100 templates
for each relation.
Step 1: Manually rewriting relational templates.
The manual rewriting of the relational templates
is performed by the first author of this paper. We
create new templates by describing the relationship
between subject and object from different perspec-
tives rather than creating templates with absolutely
the same meaning with original template. Utiliz-
ing the resource provided by Wikidata 19, we not
only paraphrase existing templates to generate new
ones with diverse lexicons but also devise entail-
ment expressions to encompass various semantic
expressions that convey the same relations. These
newly created templates are guaranteed to uphold
relational equivalence, following the relationship
17https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:
Identifiers
18https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:
EntityData/<entity_identifier>.json
19https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:
<relation_identifier>
between the subject and object. Taking P20 ([X]
died in [Y].)20 as an example, we create new tem-
plates by either changing the sentence pattern or
adding type information of object (e.g, [X] resided
in [Y] until death). Furthermore, we also create
templates without directly using the keywords of
the relation (dead/death) but in a entailment way
(e.g., [X] spent the last years of life in [Y].) More-
over, we devise a question-answer style template
for each relation to enhance syntactic diversity. In
this template, the question incorporates the subject
and relation information, while the answer corre-
sponds to the object.
Note that, during the paraphrase, we observe
that some templates in LAMA-UHN only partially
express the original meaning of relations defined
in Wikidata. These are inappropriate for specific
knowledge triples. For example, P136 describes the
creative work’s genre or an artist’s field of work21,
which the type of work includes music, film, litera-
ture, etc. However, the original templates of P136
in LAMA-UHN is “[X] plays [Y] music.,” which
cannot correctly retrieve information on work other
than music. For this kinds of template, we aban-
don the original templates and newly create five
templates.
Step 2: Paraphrasing templates using GPT-4
Based on the original relation templates and the
relation templates rewritten manually, we further
paraphras these relation templates automatically
using the GPT4-API (gpt-4-1106-preview22) pro-
vided by OpenAPI. The instruction for paraphras-
ing used for GPT-4 generation is:
You are a professional tool that can para-
phrase sentences into natural sentences
that can correctly represent the relation-
ship between [X] and [Y], without repe-
tition. Make the paraphrase as diverse
as possible using simple words. Please
paraphrase the given sentence 19 times.
When the duplicated sentence is generated, we re-
move the duplication and regenerate new templates
with the same instruction, until 19 different tem-
plates is generated. Furthermore, we observe that
GPT-4 occasionally generates relation templates
that are semantically inappropriate for specific re-
lationships due to incorrect category information

21https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P136
22https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/
gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo
of entities. Consequently, in such instances, we
refine the instructions to include the category infor-
mation of the entities, ensuring accurate represen-
tation of the relationship between the subjects and
the objects. For example, when paraphrasing the
relational template “[X] used to work in [Y].”23,
we additionally add explicit guidance regarding
the expected format and semantics of the relation
templates to the above instruction, as following.
Be aware that [Y] is the geographic loca-
tion but NOT company or organization,
where persons or organizations were ac-
tively participating in employment, busi-
ness or other work.
As a result, we can obtain the following para-
phrased relational templates for “[X] used to work
in [Y].”:
• “[X] was formerly employed in [Y].”
• “[X] once worked at [Y].”
• “[Y] was the place where [X] used to be en-
gaged in work.”
A.3
Example of extended relational templates
in MyriadLAMA
We display part of the created templates in Myr-
iadLAMA. We randomly select two manually
rewritten templates and three auto-generated tem-
plates of these two templates.
We show the
sampled templates for all the relations in Ta-
bles 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25.
B
The Advangage of MyriadLAMA
Given that our study seeks to mitigate the influence
of individual prompt bias in evaluations, the avail-
ability of a wide range of prompts characterized in
both quantity and diversity is crucial. The diversity
ensures that different prompts can capture different
aspects of the true knowledge distribution. On the
other side, the quality or correctness of prompts
ensure the evaluation can accurately reflect the true
knowledge recall ability.
In this section, we provide a quantitative anal-
ysis of the quality and diversity of multi-prompt
factual knowledge probing datasets. The compar-
ison results demonstrate the superiority of Myri-
adLAMA over previous datasets, enabling more
23https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P937
accurate and comprehensive evaluations. We con-
duct comparison between MyriadLAMA and other
multi-prompts probing datasets, LPAQA (Jiang
et al., 2020) and PARAREL (Elazar et al., 2021),
from the perspective of quantity and diversity.
B.1
Diversity comparison
We measure the diversity of multi-prompt factual
knowledge probing datasets from both quantity
and linguistic diversity.
Specifically, we calculate the average number
of prompts for each subject-relation pair as the
quantity measure. MyriadLAMA introduces di-
versity into prompts by using various subject ex-
pressions and relational templates. On average,
MyriadLAMA provides 2.47 expressions for each
subject. In addition, we measure the linguistic di-
versity of relational templates from three aspects,
as shown below:
Lexicon: We utilize the Jaccard distance of words
in templates to gauge lexicon diversity.
Syntax: We adopt the syntax distance measure pro-
posed in (Oya, 2020), which calculates the
distance between dependency trees.
Semantics: We quantify semantic diversity by cal-
culating the L2 distance of sentence embed-
dings given by BERTlarge.
The results are shown in Table 9. MyriadLAMA
demonstrates superior quantity and diversity com-
pared to existing multi-prompt factual probing
datasets. Although LPAQA exhibits greater se-
mantic diversity, this is mainly due to its use of
distant supervision to discover new templates. This
method often results in problematic templates that
inadequately describe the relationships between
subjects and objects. For example, for relation
P93724 (“[X] used to work in [Y].”), LPAQA in-
cludes templates like “[X] to meet [Y],” which sig-
nificantly deviate from the original semantic mean-
ing. We analyze and compare template quality in
the next section.
B.2
Quality comparison
In this section, we evaluate the quality of relational
templates created MyriadLAMA in correctly ex-
pressing the relation between the subject and object.
We manually evaluate the quality templates created
in each dataset through a strict quality evaluation

framework. Specifically, we evaluate each template
based on its fluency and its ability to correctly ex-
press the semantic relationship between subjects
and objects. Given the complex and specific con-
straints defined by Wikidata relations, creating per-
fect templates that satisfy all subjects and objects
for a given relation is challenging.
B.2.1
Semantic relationship between template
and relation
[Template ⊆Relation]: If the subject and object
fit the template, it is correct for the relation, but
the relation’s knowledge range is broader than the
template can cover. We denote such templates as
[Template ⊆Relation]. Using the templates in
LAMA-UHN, which are often considered golden
templates as examples, relation P13625 uses the
template “[X] plays [Y] music.” to describe cre-
ative work genres or an artist’s field. However,
P136 encompasses film, literature, and other arts,
not just music.
[Relation ⊆Template]: In contrast, If the subject-
object pair is true for the relation, it is also true for
the template, meaning the template’s knowledge
range is broader than the relation. For example,
LAMA-UHN creates the template “[X] died in [Y].”
for P2026. While this template can be used to infer
a person’s place of death, “[Y]” could also be the
year “[X]” passed away.
[Relation ∩Template > 0]: Additionally, some
templates do not fit neatly into either [Relation ⊆
Template] or [Template ⊆Relation] but can still
correctly describe the relationship for some subject-
object pairs. For example, PARAREL, which para-
phrases templates by human effort, uses “[X] is a
follower of [Y].” to describe relation P14027 (reli-
gion or worldview). This template is appropriate
for individuals but not for organizations, and it does
not fully capture the relation’s scope. Therefore, it
does not fit [Relation ⊆Template]. Additionally,

Figure 5: The relationship between the factual knowl-
edge that can be covered by relation and template.
when “[X]” is a person, “[Y]” can be either a re-
ligious figure, leader, or the religion itself, which
does not satisfy [Template ⊆Relation]. However,
many subject-relation pairs can still be correctly
captured by this template. We use [Relation ∩
Template > 0] to denote them.
[Irrelevant]: We consider templates that do not
correctly convey the relationship between subject
and object as [Irrelevant]. For example, LPAQA
mined many irrelevant templates from the corpus
without careful checking, resulting in low-quality
templates, such as “[X] arrived in [Y]” for P937.
[Fully matching]: Finally, we use [Fully match-
ing] to denote templates that can accurately capture
all the subject-object pairs fitting in the relation.
We demonstrate the five types of semantic rela-
tionships between template and relation in Figure 5
using the Venn diagram.
B.2.2
Template quality evaluation metrics
To accurately capture the fluency and the ability
of created templates to correctly express the rela-
tionship between subjects and objects, we use the
following metrics to score template quality. Each
item is scored as either 1 or 0 based on whether the
template meets the requirement.
1) Fluency: Is the template a natural sentence or
noun phrase28? Set 1 if the templates are natural;
Otherwise 0.
2) [Relation ⊆Template]: If the template can
satisfy the definition of [Template ⊆Relation],
then 1; Otherwise 0.
3) [Template ⊆Relation]: If the template can
satisfy the definition of [Template ⊆Relation],
then 1; Otherwise 0.
28We take the noun phrase into consideration as LPAQA
created lots of noun phrase templates, such as “[X], who
works as [Y].“ for relation P106 (https://www.wikidata.
org/wiki/Property:P106)
4) [Relation ∩Template > 0]: If the template can
satisfy the definition of [Relation ∩Template >
0], then 1; Otherwise 0.
If either [Relation ⊆Template] or [Template
⊆Relation] is 1, then [Relation ∩Template > 0]
must also be 1. If [Relation ⊆Template], [Tem-
plate ⊆Relation], and [Relation ∩Template >
0] are all 0, the template can is classified as [Irrel-
evant]. If all three metrics are 1, the template is
classified as [Fully Matching].
Specifically, as what PLMs see is the prompt
with subject, we will consider the existence of
subject when scoring the template. For example,
P41329 describe the position or specialism of a
player on a team. While the template “[X] plays in
the position of [Y].” can be too general, as it could
also describe a player’s position in an orchestra,
specifying “[X]” in the prompt reduces ambiguity,
making it an accurate [Fully Matching] template
to describe the relation.
B.2.3
Evaluation result and analysis
The comparison includes the 4 dataset: LAMA-
UHN, PARAREL, LPAQA and MyriadLAMA.
Considering the amount of all the templates in
the three models (6654 templates in total), we ran-
domly sample 200 templates for multi-prompt prob-
ing datasets and use all 41 templates in LAMA-
UHN for evaluation. To ensure objectivity, we
anonymize the source of each template and mix
them together for annotator (the first author). We
publicize the annotation results here30. The evalua-
tion result is shown in Table 10.
From the Table 10, We observe that our
semi-automatically generated relational templates
achieve quality comparable to manually created
datasets like LAMA-UHN and PARAREL, while
being 100 times larger than LAMA-UHN and 13.7
times larger than LPAQA. MyriadLAMA signifi-
cantly outperforms LPAQA in template quality due
to our two-stage template creation method.
Furthermore, Figure 6 shows the score distri-
butions for 200 templates across the three multi-
prompt datasets. It reveals that LPAQA has many
low-score templates, with 0 being the most com-
mon score.
Compared to PARAREL, Myriad-
LAMA has slightly more templates with a score of
3 but slightly fewer with a score of 4, resulting in
slightly lower overall quality.

Ablation Analysis of MyriadLAMA
In this section, we conduct ablation analysis Myri-
adLAMA to understand the validity of diversifica-
tion on entities and templates.
C.1
Validity of extended entity expressions
We evaluate the validity of the extended entity ex-
pressions in MyriadLAMA by checking if these ex-
tensions cover facts that PLMs can capture but are
missed in LAMA-UHN due to strict entity expres-
sion limitations. We conduct this analysis on BERT
models, focusing on facts with extended subject
and object expressions. MyriadLAMA contains
13,123 facts with extended subjects and 23,195
facts with extended objects. We measure the rate
at which extended subjects/objects achieve higher
ranks than the original expressions in the token
distribution output.
The results, shown in the Table 11 below, in-
dicate that around 50% of extended subjects and
20% of extended objects achieve higher ranks
than the original entities. This suggests that many
facts are missed in LAMA-UHN and other single-
expression factual knowledge probing datasets.
C.2
Validity of paraphrased templates
In this section, we evaluate the validity of the rela-
tion templates in MyriadLAMA. We investigate the
accuracy of each template and compare the accura-
cies between templates in LAMA-UHN, manually
rewritten templates and auto-generate templates.
Specifically, for each relation, we evaluate the ac-
curacy (Acc@1) of all relation templates separately,
and then calculate the minimum, and maximum ac-
curacies among all templates for each relation. We
then measure the dataset-level minimum/maximum

the minimum/maximum template accuracies (41
templates in each set). Finally, all of the template-
specific accuracies are then micro-averaged to com-
pute the average Acc@1. As indicated in Table 12,
while the quality of MyriadLAMA’s prompts sig-
nificantly varies, the high-quality prompts are no-
tably superior to those of LAMA-UHN. Although
the average accuracy of MyriadLAMA is lower
than that of LAMA-UHN, it is considered that this
is because MyriadLAMA uses relation templates
that have been semi-automatically created, whereas
LAMA-UHN uses carefully selected entities and
templates.
C.3
What matters to robustness? Diverse
subject vs. templates
Next, we aim to investigate the factors contributing
to varying performance and inconsistent predic-
tions of prompts. MyriadLAMA creates diverse
prompts for each fact by combining different sub-
ject expressions and templates. To gauge their im-
pact on robustness, we examine both the consis-
tency (Consist) and the accuracy range (min/max)
across various expressions of subjects or relations,
assessed individually. To achieve this, the com-
plete set of prompts was partitioned into multiple

subsets, with each subset containing only one ex-
pression for each unique subjects or relations. The
Acc@1 of the prompts obtained in this manner is
then evaluated using different variants of BERT.
The results in Table 13 indicate that while the ac-
curacy range (min/max) and consistency (Consist)
caused by aliases of subjects is less pronounced
compared to diverse expressions of relational tem-
plates, its effect on factual knowledge evaluation
remains significant. These findings highlight the
vulnerability of factual knowledge evaluation based
on single prompts and underscore the significance
of harnessing the diversity of prompts within Myri-
adLAMA for robust assessments.
C.4
Manually rewritten vs. auto-generated
templates
Upon comparing relational templates gener-
ated through manual rewriting and GPT-4 auto-
generation, we find that auto-generated templates
exhibit comparable quality (accuracy) to manually
rewritten templates; they also demonstrate less di-
versity in acquiring different predictions, aligning
with our expectations.
To assess the validity of LLM-generated tem-
plates for knowledge probing, we rank the ac-
curacies (Acc@1) of manually created templates
against those generated by LLMs. Specifically,
for each relation, we rank the 5 manual templates
among all 100 templates and calculate the aver-
age rank across all manually created templates for
all relations. Table 14 shows the average Acc@1
ranks of manual templates among 100 templates on

approximate the average rank of 50, indicating that
auto-generated templates can achieve nearly the
same accuracy as manually created templates.
Furthermore, we quantify the diversity discrep-
ancy between manually written and auto-generated
templates. We categorize the auto-generated tem-
plates, including the original ones, as one group,
resulting in five groups for each relation, each
comprising 20 templates. Subsequently, we eval-
uate the similarity between templates within the
same group and across different groups using the
consistency measure (Consist), as presented in Ta-
ble 14. The consistency among prompts within the
same group (inner-group) is notably high, whereas
prompts from different groups (inter-group) exhibit
less diversity in predictions. This underscores the
significance of manual phrase rewriting, which can
yield more diverse prompts and facilitate a more
comprehensive evaluation.
D
QA-Style ICL and Its Evaluation
D.1
QA-style instruction
Beside the mask-prediction-style (MP-style) ICL
task, we also defined and evaluate a question-
answer-style (QA-style) ICL task utilizing the
QA-style relational templates available in Myri-
adLAMA. This is available because MyriadLAMA
provides 20 QA-style templates for each relation,
offering not only syntactical diversity but also suit-
ability for the autoregressive generation process
in LLMs. Each QA-style prompt adheres to a for-
mat where the subject and relation construct the
question, and the object corresponds to the answer,
such as “Who developed [X]? [Y].” For the QA
prompt, we employ the few-shot prompt compris-
ing X random QA pairs, following the format out-
lined in InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). Given
that all objects in MyriadLAMA are intended to be
matched with single words, we append the instruc-
tion “Answer each question in one word.” to

Given the limited number of templates (20 for
each relation) in the QA-style, the evaluation of
QA-style prompts represents only one-fifth of the
full prompts in MyriadLAMA.
D.2
Evaluation
We measure the ability of QA-style prompts in
adhering to instructions and compare it to MP-style
prompts. To ensure a fair comparison between QA-
and MP-style ICL, we conduct evaluations using
shared templates in both settings on Llama2-7B,
with 20 QA-style templates for each relation.
We evaluate the abilities of fact prediction and
one-word generation individually on Llama2-7B
using average Acc@1 and rate of the one-word
generation. As demonstrated in Table 4, Llama2-
7B exhibits a remarkable capability to comprehend
instructions for answering questions and generat-
ing one-word answers. We observe that QA-style
instructions perform better under the zero-shot set-
ting, likely due to decoder-based PLMs’ ability to
autoregressively generate text. However, this gap
diminishes with the use of few-shot examples. This
suggests that while MP-style prompts may slightly
underestimate the knowledge in LLMs in zero-shot
settings, MP-style ICL settings can demonstrate
comparable or even superior performance in fac-
tual knowledge prediction compared to QA-style
ICL prompts.

F.2
Model differences
We outline the differences between PLMs in their
pre-training details in Table 16, including the type
of Transformer architecture, model size, and the
size and resources of the pre-training corpora.
F.3
Evaluation results on all PLMs based on
BELIEFs
We present all evaluation results and their com-
putational costs in this section.
In Table 17,
we report the full-scale experiments using all
the prompts provided by MyriadLAMA. This in-
cludes PLMs with 8B parameters or fewer, such as
BERTbase, BERTlarge, BERTwwm, ALBERTbase,
ALBERTlarge, Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, Llama2-
7B-IT, Llama3-8B-IT, Phi3-mini (3.8B), and Phi3-
small (7B). For decoder-based models, we conduct
experiments on 4 types of ICL settings.
For PLMs with more than 8B parameters, we
report the evaluation results using partial prompts
from MyriadLAMA, specifically using manually-
rewritten templates (5 per relation), which account
for 1/20 of the prompts compared to the full-scale
experiments. Meanwhile, we run these models on
only two ICL settings: zero-shot and 4-template.
To ensure fair comparison with models having 8B
parameters or fewer, we apply the same settings
to all other decoder-based LLMs. The result is
shown in Table 18. We also list the approximate
runtime for each experiments in these two tables.
The experiments are all run on the NVIDIA RTX
6000 Ada. For experiments using model less than
or equal to 8B parameters, we use single GPU to
measure the consumption time. We use 2 GPUs for
Llama2-13B and Phi3-small and 4 GPUs for 70B
models.
Furthermore, we display the calibration level
between accuracy and confidence for a straightfor-
ward inspection on Ovconf metrics. We show the
calibration figures of models with full-scale exper-
iments in Figure 7 and experiments with partial
prompts in Figure 8.
F.4
Knowledge coverage rate on all PLMs
We present the average, maximum, and upper limit
knowledge coverage rates, as introduced in §7, for
all PLMs evaluated using all templates. The results
are shown in Figure 19.
