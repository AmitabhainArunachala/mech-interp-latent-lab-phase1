## 9.4.1 Multiplication and Division

The concepts of multiplication and division are often introduced in the early stages of primary school. Multiplication is a type of repeated addition. Division is a type of repeated subtraction.

## 9.4.2 Multiplication

When we multiply a number by a number, we are essentially taking that number and repeating it as many times as the other number dictates. For example, we know

### Answer

15/25: We have to simplify the fraction 15/25.

In order to do this, we have to realize that 5 is a factor of both 15 and 25.

This means that we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5.

15/25 = 15/25

15/25 = 15/

In the beginning, people used to travel to the Himalayas to measure the height of the mountain. But, we’ll use the most modern and accurate method to measure the height of Everest.

The first important thing one should know is that the height of a mountain is not the same as its elevation above the sea. The height is the vertical distance from the base of the mountain to its peak. The elevation is the vertical distance from
