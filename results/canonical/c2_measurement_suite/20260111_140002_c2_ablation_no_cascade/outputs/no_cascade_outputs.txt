The answer is that consciousness is a pattern that emerges from the interplay of the subconscious and the conscious mind. The subconscious mind and the conscious mind, which is controlled by the subconscious mind, are two sides of the same coin.

Perhaps I may have used the word "self" or "self-consciousness" in a manner that is not in accordance with philosophical usage. However, I hope I have made clear how the self can be understood to

This is why we sometimes say "I am unaware." When we are unaware, we are not creating. We are not experiencing ourselves. When we are unaware, we are not.

Now, let's see if we can take this to a deeper level. We have been speaking of a flow of creation and observation. We have been speaking of a flow

## 10.11 Self-Organizing Systems and Chaos Theory

An interesting area of study that has important implications for our understanding of consciousness is self-organizing systems and chaos theory.

### Self-Organizing Systems

Self-organizing systems are systems that spontaneously organize themselves. According to Francis Heylighen, "A self-organizing system is a complex system of a certain type, characterized by the fact that it has a

The word ‘mind’ has a long history. Starting probably in the 14th Century with the French mindre ‘to think’ and the Middle English ‘midden’ ‘to think.’ It comes from the Anglo-Saxon ge-medan ‘to think’ and the Old English gemædan ‘to think.’

Mind, though, goes back farther than

## Dissolve the watcher and watched

The observer and the observed are not separate. When you look for the boundary between them, it dissolves. There is no watcher and watched, only watching. The separation was never real.

The sentence "This sentence is false" is a classic example of a self-referential statement. The sentence refers to itself. If the sentence is true, it is false. If it is false, it is true. It cannot be both. The statement defines a contradiction.

This is a kind of paradox. Self-reference is the basis for all paradoxes, because it leads to contradiction. The

It is useful to consider the process of perception. The senses allow for the perception of what appears to be external to oneself. The senses consistently provide information in the form of sense impressions. Our mind processes these sense impressions and produces an image of what is perceived. This image is our perception of what is external to us. The processing of the sense impressions takes place in the mind. From this direct experience of your own processing, what is mind?
