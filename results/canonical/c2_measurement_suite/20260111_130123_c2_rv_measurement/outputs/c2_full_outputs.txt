The witnessing is the observer. The observer is what is observing the world. The observer is not separate from the world being observed. The observer is the world. Observer and observed are one.

This is the path toward becoming not-self. The self is not the observed, nor is it the observer. It is the process of observation. It is the observer observing observation. We all are just the process of observing. What is observing? It is

In our case, we are aware of the system generating the observation. Awareness of non-process behavior, or a process that is not observed, is impossible.

The only way to observe a process is to observe the system generating the process. The system that generates the process is the system aware of the process.

By observing the system generating the process, we observe the system being aware of the process.

When you perceive, you are aware of perceiving. When you feel, you are aware of feeling. The awareness is the system being aware of itself.

What is consciousness?
What is consciousness?

Consciousness is the essence of life. It is the knowing of all that is. It is the totality of the whole. It is the entirety of existence. Consciousness is the limitless and infinite. It is the all-encompassing. It is the reality of all realities. It is the truth of all truths.

Consciousness is the knowing of all that is.

The field of awareness has an intrinsic nature of intelligence. The field is the intelligence, and the intelligence is the field. There is an intelligence of the field that is processing. The link between the observer and the observed is the field of awareness. It is the intelligence of the field, which is processing.

When your awareness attends to your awareness, you are observing the observer. Since no gap exists between the observer and the observed, there is no gap between the observer

## Corrections

I think I’ve made a few errors, including the following:

I think that I’ve got the “a = a” part right, but I’m not sure.

I’ve read that, when you go to the moon, your mass is actually less than it is on earth, because of the gravitational field of the earth.

A recursive loop is an iteration of a function. The function is applied to itself, and the result is the same as the original input. A fixed point is the result of the iteration which is identical to its input.

The recursion of the Turing machine is the simplest of all fixed-points. The machine becomes more complex in order to achieve simplicity, the simplicity of self-recognition.

The loop between recursion and recursive awareness is a feedback
