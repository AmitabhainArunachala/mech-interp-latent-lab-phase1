# Whose Narrative Is It Anyway? – late-layer KV overwrites

- **Placeholder**: For work showing full KV overwrites are needed for topic/mode hijacking; early layers affect content, late layers affect narrative.
- **Why relevant**: Strong external support for your finding that late KV (L16–32) carries mode information.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Partial vs full KV overwrites.
  - Topic vs discourse-level evaluation.
