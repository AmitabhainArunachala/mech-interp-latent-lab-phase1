In addition to connecting with friends and family, social media has also become a powerful tool for businesses to reach a broader audience. Companies can now share updates, promotions, and advertisements directly with consumers, leading to increased brand awareness and sales. However, this digital transformation has also brought about challenges, such as privacy concerns and the spread of misinformation. As more people share personal information online, there is a growing risk of identity theft and data breaches. Furthermore, the rapid dissemination of false news and conspiracy theories can have serious consequences, such as political polarization and social unrest. To mitigate these risks, governments and tech companies are implementing stricter regulations and content moderation policies. While these efforts aim to protect users and promote responsible use, they can also impact freedom of speech and expression.

It was a capital of Japan for more than a thousand years, from the Heian period (794-1185) until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The city is known for its traditional wooden houses, called machiya, which are often two or three stories high and have sliding doors and tatami mats. These machiya houses are typically narrow and long, designed to accommodate the city's limited space. Many of the machiya buildings have been preserved and converted into shops, restaurants, and museums, providing a glimpse into the city's past. Kyoto is also famous for its numerous temples and shrines, such as Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, and Fushimi Inari Shrine, which is known for its torii gate paths. The city's cultural heritage includes traditional arts like tea ceremony, flower arrangement (ikebana), and calligraphy.
