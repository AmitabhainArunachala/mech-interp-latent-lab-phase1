##### What is the answer?

The answer is 212.

##### How to calculate the answer?

The answer is calculated by subtracting the second number from the first number.

$4 - 3 = 1$

Then add the answer to the first number.

$12 + 1 = 13$

Then finally, multiplied the answer by the first number.

$13 \times 12 = 212$
