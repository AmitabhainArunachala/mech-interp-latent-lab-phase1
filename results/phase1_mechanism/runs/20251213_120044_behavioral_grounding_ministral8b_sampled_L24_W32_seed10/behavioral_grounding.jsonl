With its wrought iron lattice, the tower was initially criticized for its design but has since become an iconic landmark. It was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World's Fair, and it initially served as a symbol of progress and industry. Today, the tower attracts millions of tourists each year, offering panoramic views of the city from its three levels.

The tower's three levels are interconnected by elevators and stairs, each offering a unique perspective of Paris. At night, the tower sparkles with an enchanting light show, known as the \"Eiffel Tower Sparkle,\" highlighting the tower's beauty in the dark. The first level offers a restaurant with panoramic views, while the second level hosts the \"58 Tour Eiffel\" champagne bar.
