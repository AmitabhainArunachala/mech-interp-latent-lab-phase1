The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of
bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with power-law hopping decaying with
distance as 1/rα with finite integral over space – corresponding in spin language to a XY model
with power-law couplings – undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact
quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent
α, focusing on the regime α > 2. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system
size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any α ≤3 – a behavior incompatible with the
BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis
near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent
satisfying the Harris bound ν ≥2 and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons
in one dimension. For α > 3 our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned
by infinitesimal disorder.
Bosonic particles with local interactions in one dimen-
sion (1D) are described by a universal harmonic the-
ory, known as Luttinger liquid (LL). The latter corre-
sponds to quantized superfluid hydrodynamics (including
instantons) and is fully characterized by the superfluid
velocity, v =
p
Ys/κ, and LL parameter, K = π√κYs,
with κ the compressibility and Ys the superfluid stiffness.
Diagonal disorder induces an instability in LL towards
a non-superfluid Bose glass (BG) phase – a compress-
ible insulator displaying exponential decay of off-diagonal
correlations. In their seminal paper [1], Giamarchi and
Schulz found by means of a perturbative renormalization
group (RG) analysis that the LL-BG transition is of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type that takes
place at the universal value K = Kc = 3/2 (this result
holds at the two-loop level [2]). In the strong-disorder
limit, real-space RG treatments [3, 4] and the “scratched-
XY” criticality [5] also predict a BKT-type transition but
at a non-universal value of Kc > 3/2. These considera-
tions exhaust known scenarios for the disorder-induced
superfluid to non-superfluid phase transitions in 1D.
In this work, we consider the disorder-induced localiza-
tion transition in 1D superfluids of bosons with power-
law hopping decaying with distance as 1/rα. We utilize
numerically exact large scale Quantum Monte-Carlo sim-
ulations based on the Worm Algorithm [6] to determine
the ground-state superfluid phases and phase transitions
for different values of α > 2. We find that the super-
fluid phases can be approximately characterized by an
effective LL parameter K that reproduces the decay of
correlation functions. However, contrary to existing the-
ories, we find that the disorder-induced quantum phase
transition is generically scale-invariant and incompatible
with the BKT scenario with the effective Kc ≤3/2 for
all α ≤3. As far as critical exponents are concerned,
the data is consistent with the correlation length expo-
nent satisfying the Harris bound ν ≥2 for all values of
α ≤3. Thus, our results reveal a new universal behav-
ior of bosons with power-law hopping in one dimension
with finite integral over space. For α > 3 our results are
instead consistent with a scenario where the superfluid
is pinned by an infinitesimal disorder in the thermody-
namic limit, similar to a BKT-like scenario for hard-core
particles with short-range coupling. Our predictions are
directly relevant for experiments with dipolar atoms and
molecules, exciton materials, and cold ions.

We employ standard notations for bosonic creation and
annihilation operators on site i and restrict the maximal
occupation number, ni = b†
ibi, to unity.
The nearest-
neighbor hopping amplitude, t, and the lattice spacing, a,
are taken as units of energy and length, respectively. We
choose random on-site energies ϵi uniformly distributed
between −W and W, and check that a different (gaus-
sian) choice of distribution does not affect the results. In
spin language, Eq. (1) is equivalent to an XY Hamilto-
nian with power-law exchange couplings, which, in the
absence of disorder, can be realized in experiments with
cold polar molecules [7], trapped ions [8–10] and Rydberg
atoms [11–16] (the latter can also be disordered [17]).
For ideal system with W/t = 0, the spectra and low-
energy phases of Hamiltonian (1) have been investigated
by a variety of approaches. Using linear spin-wave the-
ory, Ref. [18] identified α > 3 as a regime where main
properties reproduce those observed in the α = ∞limit
of finite-range interactions; 1 < α < 3 as an intermediate
regime with the XY phase characterized by a contin-
uously varying dynamical exponent z = (α −1)/2 (it
governs the k →0 limit of the dispersion relation); and
α < 1 as a long-range regime with dispersionless excita-
tions and properties similar to the infinite-range α = 0

case in the thermodynamic limit. In this harmonic ap-
proach, α = 3 is the boundary between the intermediate
and short-range regimes. Using a bosonization approach
supplemented by an RG analysis, Ref. [19] predicts that
power-law couplings are relevant in the RG sense for
α < 3 −1/(2K), with K > 1 to be determined numer-
ically for each given α. In the following, we study the
ground-state superfluid phases and phase transitions of
Eq. (1) for α > 2 using large scale path-integral quantum
Monte-Carlo simulations based on the Worm algorithm
[6]. Without loss of generality, we focus on the particle
density ρ = 1/2.
We start our analysis by first characterizing the
bosonic liquid in the absence of disorder (W/t = 0).
Figure 1(a) shows the dispersion relation E(k) vs k for
three values of α = 2.5, 3.0, and 3.2 where k is the
quasi-momentum. It was deduced numerically from spec-
tral peaks after analytic continuation of the imaginary-
frequency dynamic structure factor [20, 21]. The chosen
values of α correspond to values in the expected inter-
mediate (α = 2.5), boundary (α = 3.0) and short-range
(α = 3.2) limits of the spin-wave analysis, respectively.
The dispersion relation is non-linear in k for α = 2.5
(dots) and the data can be fit well by E(k) ∼kz∗, with
z∗≃0.74, in good agreement with the z = 0.75 pre-
diction of spin-wave analysis (continuous black line). In
the short-range regime, instead, the dispersion relation
is consistent with the linear law and a small negative
quadratic contribution, also in agreement with literature.
We checked that E(k) for different system sizes agree
with each other for the same values of k. [The disper-
sion relation in the superfluid phase for α = 2.5 in the
presence of disorder is sub-linear, as presented in the Sup-
plemental Material [22].]
For a 1D superfluid ground state, the single-particle
density matrix G(ℓ) = ⟨b†
ibi+ℓ⟩is expected to show an
algebraic decay with the distance ℓwith diverging inte-
gral over space. Our data for G are shown in Fig. 1(b),
for the same values of α as in panel (a) for a system with
L = 512 sites and inverse temperature β = L/t.
We
observe algebraic decay G ∼ℓ−γ for all α.
Despite the non-linear dispersion relation demon-
strated above, we attempt a comparison with expecta-
tions from LL theory by extracting an effective LL pa-
rameter K as a function of α from two standard meth-
ods: the power-law decay G ∼ℓ−γ via the bosoniza-
tion relation γ = 1/(2K) (green dots) and the rela-
tion K = π√κYs (red squares).
Both κ and Ys can
be conveniently computed by quantum Monte Carlo
through mean-square particle, N, and winding num-
ber, W, fluctuations using the Pollock–Ceperley relation
Ys = L⟨W2⟩/β. Figure 1(c) shows that the two meth-
ods produce similar estimates of K for all α, within the
error bars, which is surprising, given the non-linear dis-
persion relation demonstrated above. Moreover, K de-
creases monotonically and continuously with α from a
large value K ≳5 at α ∼2.3 to K ≈1 at α = 4. Within
an approximate LL scenario, this behavior may be ex-

plained by the fact that power-law hopping in Hamil-
tonian (1) allows for large-scale particle exchanges for
small enough α < 3, mimicking the behavior of soft-core
bosons, for which one can easily get K ≫1. The K = 1
value (dashed dotted line) corresponds to the short-range
case of hard-core bosons with the nearest neighbor hop-
ping, a limit that is here asymptotically approached at
α > 3 [23]. In the following we analyse the situation at
finite disorder strength and, in particular, explore the na-
ture of the transition point, which is expected to be of the
BKT type for Luttinger liquids. However, we note that
this may not be the case here: BKT transition and its
asymptotically exact RG flow are rooted in logarithmic
interactions between vortex excitations. The latter origi-
nates from the kinetic energy of the flow around vortexes

vortexes in the superfluid phase should be bound by a

fluctuations ⟨W2⟩since they are a scale invariant quan-
tity, differently from the superfluid stiffness Ys. Figure
2(a) shows the evolution of superfluid properties mea-
sured by ⟨W2⟩with disorder, W/t, for two example cases
α = 2.7 (empty symbols) and 3.2 (full symbols) and for
several values of L = 64, 128, 256. In both cases, ⟨W2⟩
decrease monotonically with increasing W/t, until they
reach near zero values. This behavior signals the tran-
sition between the superfluid and non-superfluid states.
In the short-range case α = 3.2, the behavior at larger
values of disorder is reminiscent of what is expected for
a BKT transition when in the infinite system ⟨W2⟩dis-
plays a jump to zero at the critical point [23]. However,
surprisingly, for α = 2.7 there is a clear crossing point
of ⟨W2⟩around W/t ∼2. This is inconsistent with the
BKT criticality and is, instead, a signature of continuous
scale-invariant phase transitions. This fact can be used
to pinpoint the critical disorder strength Wc where su-
perfluidity is lost by the crossing point of ⟨W2⟩-vs- W
curves for different values of L.
The panels (b)-(e) in
Fig. 2 present data in the vicinity of transition points
for α = 2.5, 2.7, 3.0 and 3.2 using β = L/(8t) [even
for α = 3.2 our temperature is a factor of two smaller
than the lowest phonon mode]. Crossing points are very
pronounced in (b) and (c) for intermediate exponents α,
leaving no doubt that we are dealing with generic con-
tinuous transitions at W/t = 3.24(5) for α = 2.5 and at
W/t = 2.12(5) for α = 2.7. The crossings appear to per-
sist when transitioning to the short-range regime α ≳3,
see panels (d) and (e) in Fig. 2 with crossings around
4
W/t = 0.87(5) for α = 3.0 and around W/t = 0.5(5) for
α = 3.2, contrary to all expectations. However a careful
finite-size scaling up to large system sizes L = 1024 shows
that the transition point for α > 3 scales to W/t →0 in
the thermodynamic limit, see Inset in Fig. 2(e), implying
the absence of a continuous phase transition at finite W
in the thermodynamic limit. This is different from α ≤3,
where the transition point scales to a finite value of W/t,
see Insets in Fig. 2(b-d). The breakdown of the BKT
scenario for all values 2 < α ≤3 in Eq. (1) is surprising
and is the main result of this work.
Figure 3(a) summarizes the ground state phase dia-
gram of Hamiltonian (1) in terms of Wc and α. Here, for
each α ≤3, the critical point Wc is determined from the
scale-invariant crossing point as described above.
The
critical disorder strength Wc/t decreases monotonically
from a large value Wc/t ∼5.1 to ∼0.9 for α = 3. For
α > 3 the transition in the thermodynamic limit occurs
at Wc/t = 0+.
The limiting value Wc/t = 0+ would
correspond to the strictly short-range limit of hard-core
bosons with short-range hopping, which are known to be
localized by an infinitesimal disorder [23].
Figure 3(b) shows the critical LL parameter Kc com-
puted at Wc/t for each value of α assuming that the
approximate LL scenario properly describes the system.
We find that, for α ≲3, Kc remains smaller than the
critical BKT value of 3/2 for short-range hopping mod-
els with weak disorder [23], confirming that LL theory
should not be used to describe the localization transition
in the whole range α ≤3. In contrast, for α > 3 our re-
sults are in agreement with conclusion that ideal systems
with K < 3/2 are ultimately pinned by disorder, leading
to an insulating BG phase for any finite value of W/t.
We complete our characterization of quantum phase
transition in Fig.
3(a) by determining the correlation
length exponent ν using data collapse analysis near the
critical points [24].
For each α, the results of Monte
Carlo simulations are rescaled by L−ζ/νYs and collapsed
on a single master curve using L1/ν[(W/t) −(Wc/t)] as a
variable. Critical values Wc/t are taken from the crossing
points in Fig.
2, while ν and ζ are treated as fitting
parameters and obtained using a Nelder-Mead algorithm
[25] with a cost function based on the Kawashima-Ito-
Houdayer-Hartmann quality metric [26, 27].
Example
results for α = 2.5, 2.7, 3.0 and α = 3.2 are shown in
Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. We observe good collapse
of all data near the critical points for α ≥2, and the
obtained correlation length exponents always satisfy the
so-called Harris bound ν ≳2, see [28]. In fact, this result
is expected from general arguments for a large class of d-
dimensional disordered systems where an appropriately
defined correlation length diverges [29].
Data collapse
for α > 3 using Wc/t = 0.57 is a finite-size effect given
that this value of α is close to the boundary between
the intermediate and short-range regimes and crossing
points slowly shift to zero with increasing the system size.
However, this effect will likely be observed in experiments
dealing with finite systems.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the disorder-
induced superfluid to non-superfluid quantum phase
transition for models with power-law hopping is a scale-
invariant transition if 2 < α ≤3, ruling out the ex-
pected BKT scenario for interacting one-dimensional
bosons in this regime.
Our work opens up multiple
other research directions, including whether the finite-
temperature BKT scenario is generally inconsistent with
power-law hopping models also in two dimensions [30–
32].
Another open question is the nature of the non-
superfluid quantum phase for general values of α. In Ref.
[33] it was conjectured that for α = 3 this phase is a non-
superfluid Bose metal phase with finite zero-frequency
optical conductivity and algebraic decay of correlations.
It is an open question whether similar behavior can be
found for other α values. Our predictions should be di-
5
rectly testable in experiments for XY models realized via
internal excitations of cold dipolar atoms and molecules,
cold ions chains, and Rydberg atoms.

In this work, we study a one-dimensional disordered lattice boson model with hopping amplitude decaying with
distance as 1/rα using large scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations.
A recent work [1] based on approximate
functional renormalization group methods (submitted to the archive after our work was published online) proposes
that in the stable superfluid phase at finite disorder strength (W/t > 0), a density mode with linear dispersion
(dynamical exponent z = 1) should emerge and the superfluid–Bose-glass transition follows the BKT universality
class for any α, in contradiction to our results. In this Supplemental Material we check the predictions of [1]. Our
analysis based on large scale numerical simulations confirms the picture that we present in the main text.
I.
DISPERSION RELATION IN THE SUPERFLUID PHASE WITH FINITE DISORDER
The study presented in [1] proposes, using approximate functional renormalization group methods, that in the
stable superfluid phase a density mode with linear dispersion (dynamical exponent z = 1) should emerge, and that
the superfluid–Bose-glass transition follows the BKT universality class. To test these predictions, we performed large
scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations for α = 2.5 and disorder strength W/t = 2.0 to determine the dispersion
relation by numerically analyzing the spectral peaks after performing an analytic continuation of the imaginary-
frequency dynamic structure factor [2, 3].

FIG. 1. Dispersion relation E(k) vs k for α = 2.5 in the superfluid phase at finite disorder strength W/t = 2.0.
Our results, presented in Figure 1 of this Supplemental Material, demonstrate that the spectrum is non-linear in
k for α = 2.5 at W = 2.0 and the data is well described by E(k) ∼kz∗, with z∗≃0.76. We checked for finite size
effects (e.g., L = 64 in the figure), founding no significant impact. These results contradict the theoretical predictions
of linear dispersion proposed in [1].
