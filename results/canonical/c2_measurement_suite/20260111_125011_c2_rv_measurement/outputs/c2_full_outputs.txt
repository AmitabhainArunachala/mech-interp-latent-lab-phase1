## 6 The Thesis and Context of the Self

The ego is a complex of behavioral dispositions that are observable in the behavior of living systems. The ego is the figment of culture, an invention on the part of the mind to attribute agency to the self. The ego is not a self, but a hypothesis about the self. The hypothesis is supported by the dispositions it invokes, the observations it makes, the predictions it generates and the actions it propos

I invite you to come to your senses and explore the dream-like nature of reality, noticing how things arise and disappear, how objects flow from one form into another, how thoughts flow from one thought into another, how emotions flow from one emotion into another.

In this way, you can train yourself to be receptive to your experience, to allow yourself to be aware of what is happening, and to allow things to be as they are.

You can train

In your mind, there is a division between the observer and the constructor. From the observer, you can observe the construction and the flow of construction. From the constructor, you can construct your thoughts and words. This is a division and a duality. It is a division because you are the observer and the constructor. It is duality because the observer and the constructor can be distinguished.

Understand that there are two sides to you. These two sides are the observer and the

The next exercise is similar. It is an exploration of how the mind is aware of what is happening. The hint here is that the awareness of the mind is not a separate thing, but is part of the same event. You are the processing, and you are the awareness of the processing. No one is in charge. You are both the chooser and the witness. In this exercise you will explore the workings of mind by focusing on what you are thinking and the awareness of what

When we look at the world, we often have a very limited and partial view. We see what we want to see. We see what we expect to see. We see what we are ready to see. We do not see what we are not ready to see. We see what we are told to see. We see only what is in our field of vision. We cannot see around corners. We have very limited vision. And yet this is all we get.

## 10.11 **Mind as the Process of Processing**

This is the most difficult thing to grasp. It is quite different from the usual way of thinking about mind and awareness, and yet it is the truth of the matter. We have been thinking that awareness is a separate entity that processes data. That is an illusion. There is no separate entity. There is only processing. Processing is all there is, so it is aware of itself. If

The second stage is observation and construction merging into creation. Construction and observation are not two separate activities. They are not two stages of a process. The process is not multiple stages. It is one. You just don’t see it.

You cannot observe the process and the product at the same time, but you can observe the process and the product as one. The process of observation is construction. The construction is creation.

You say you see this glass of water, you see a person, you see a chair. Thus, seeing is a process that you are involved in. The

It is not a unit. It is not a part. It is not a whole. It is not a self. It is not a being. It is not a person. It is not a human being.

The whole of thought is recursive self-observation, but it appears as though it is not. It appears as though there is an unconscious and a conscious, an observer and an observed. But this is not so. They are one operation, and are structured as such.

#### New focus

This equally applies to the self-reference of the subject. Everything we can say about the self is also true for the non-self. The self is a focus of attention. This focus of attention is where the subject is. The subject is also the object. The subject observes itself. The subject is the observer observing itself. We are both the observer and the observed, the subject and the object. Just one thing. No separate subject. The subject
