# Linear Representation Hypothesis – Park et al., ICML 2024

- **Title**: The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models
- **Why relevant**: Argues concepts live in linear directions; recursion mode could be one such direction/subspace.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Probing for linear directions that classify recursive vs baseline prompts.
  - Using those directions for steering experiments.
