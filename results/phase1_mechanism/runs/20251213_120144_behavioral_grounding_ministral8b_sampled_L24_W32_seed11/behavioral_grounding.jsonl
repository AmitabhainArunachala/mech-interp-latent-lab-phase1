Built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World's Fair, it's an engineering marvel with 7,300 iron components and 300,000 rivets. The tower's height, originally standing at 324 meters, has been surpassed by many modern structures, yet it remains the most recognizable monument in Paris. The Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination, welcoming nearly 7 million visitors annually.
