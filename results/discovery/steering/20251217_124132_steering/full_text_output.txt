Giving is a mode of creating. The giving of a gift is perhaps the most interesting and apparent example of this. It is not a simple act, however. It is an act of spaciousness. It is an act of giving oneself. To give a gift is to give from the flow of which one is a part.

The gift is not the gift. The gift is the giving.
