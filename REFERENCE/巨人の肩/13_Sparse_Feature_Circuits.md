# Sparse Feature Circuits – Marks et al., 2024

- **Title**: Sparse Feature Circuits: Discovering and Editing Interpretable Circuits in LLMs
- **Why relevant**: Bridges SAE features to circuits; ideal for turning a "recursive feature" into a full path.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Feature-level path patching.
  - Circuit graphs over SAE features.
