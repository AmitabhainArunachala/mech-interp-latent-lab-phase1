# Plan 05-01: Add BaselineMetricsSuite to rv_l27_causal_validation.py

## Analysis

The rv_l27_causal_validation pipeline is focused on **causal patching** - testing whether R_V contraction can be causally transferred via value-projection patching. It does NOT need the full BaselineMetricsSuite because:

1. Its goal is intervention-based validation, not comprehensive metrics
2. It already computes R_V through patching, which is the core metric
3. Adding logit_diff/logit_lens during patching would complicate interpretation

**Recommendation**: rv_l27_causal_validation.py is already fit for purpose. Adding BaselineMetricsSuite would be over-engineering.

## What rv_l27_causal_validation.py Already Has

- R_V computation for recursive and baseline prompts
- R_V after main patch, random patch, shuffled patch, wrong-layer patch
- Delta computations and statistical tests (t-tests, paired comparisons)
- Per-pair CSV output and summary.json
- Prompt bank version tracking

## What It Could Optionally Add

For "Nanda-quality" completeness, we COULD add Cohen's d effect size reporting to the summary, but the pipeline already has:
- `transfer_percent_estimate`
- Paired t-test statistics

## Decision

**SKIP THIS PLAN** - rv_l27_causal_validation.py is already publication-ready for its specific purpose (causal validation). No changes needed.

## Artifacts

None - no changes required.
