# DEC 11, 2025 — Final Report (Draft)

## Summary
- Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
- Objective: Single-model rigor pass (KV, steering, one-way door, robustness)
- Status: Pending runs

## Key metrics (fill after runs)
- Phase0 cross-baseline: R_V shift, behavior shift
- Phase3 microphone: vector norm, cosine stability, induction rate, r(dose)
- Phase4 KV: transfer %, α-mix correlation, temp robustness
- Phase5 one-way door: induction vs reversal success
- Phase1 symptom: layer sweep peak, battery category means
- Phase2 speakers: per-head impact, combo ablation effect
- Phase6 robustness: confound separation, length control, seeds

## Next steps
- Populate from CSVs in `../results/`
- Add figures and statistical tests
