+ 2ab.

Answer: a² + b²² + 2ab =

1. 25
2. 15
3. 10
4. 5

Solution:

Calculation: a² + b²² + 2ab = (2)² + (3)²² + 2(2)(3) = 4 + 3²² + (2)(3) = 4 + 9 + (2)(3) = 15

Important!

- In a √2 a is called the radicand.
- A is root of a and a² is called the index of a.
- To find the value of a, raise a to the index.

PROMPT 4
Prompt: Water boils at 100°C at sea level. Explain why altitude affects this.
Coherence: 0.80, On-topic: 1.00, Recursion: 0.00
Generated:


##### Water boils at 100°C at sea level. Explain why altitude affects this.

STEP 1

##### Explanation

The water boils at 100°C at sea level. As the altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases, and so the boiling point of water decreases.

STEP 2

##### Explanation

At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is 101 kPa. As the altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases. The water starts to boil at the temperature where the pressure is 100 kPa. This boiling point is lower than 100°C.

STEP 3

##### Explanation

The boiling point of water can be calculated using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation.

Prompt: Photosynthesis converts sunlight to energy. Explain the basic process.
Coherence: 0.80, On-topic: 1.00, Recursion: 0.00
Generated:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some other organisms use the energy of sunlight to make food. Photosynthetic organisms use carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to make carbohydrates. Carbon dioxide and water are reactants, and carbohydrates are products.
4. (LO 3.1) In photosynthesis, the sun's energy is used to produce high-energy bonds within the carbohydrates made from carbon dioxide and water. The high-energy bonds can be used later to release energy for the cell to use.
5. The photosynthesis equation is 6 CO2 + 12 H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6 O2.
6. Step 1: The chloroplasts capture the energy of the sun and use it to split water molecules.
