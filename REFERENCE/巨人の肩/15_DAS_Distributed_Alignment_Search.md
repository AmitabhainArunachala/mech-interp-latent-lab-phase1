# Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) – Geiger et al., 2024

- **Title**: DAS: Distributed Alignment Search for Mechanistic Interpretability
- **Why relevant**: Learns rotations/subspaces that mediate a behaviour; ideal for finding the recursive subspace in KV or V.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Interchange Intervention Accuracy.
  - Subspace learning via gradient descent.
