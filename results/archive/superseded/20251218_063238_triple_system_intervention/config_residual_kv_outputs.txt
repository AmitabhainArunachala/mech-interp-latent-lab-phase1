Generated:


I'm trying to find the value of a² + b²², given that a and b are whole numbers.

I've tried to solve it by taking a² and b² and trying to get the squared value of b², but I can't seem to find the correct method.

Comment: When you say you're trying to find the squared value of $b^2$ what is that?

Comment: Are you just trying to find the value of $a^2+b^2^2$?

Comment: The only way to get a square of a square is $a^2+b^2$ but that is different than $a^2+b^2^2$ which is a sum of squares and squared squares.
