Prompt: Calculate: If a = 2 and b = 3, find a² + b²
Coherence: 0.80, On-topic: 1.00, Recursion: 0.00
Generated:
?

Solution:

Given: a = 2 and b = 3

To find: a² + b²²?

a² = 2² = 2 × 2 = 4

b² = 3² = 3 × 3 = 9

Now, a² + b²²? = 4 + 9²? = 4 + 9 × 9 = 4 + 81 = 85

Calculate: If a = 3 and b = 5, find a² + b²²?

Solution:

Given: a = 3 and b = 5

To find: a² + b²²?

a² = 3² = 3 × 3 = 9

b² = 5² = 5 × 5 = 25

Now, a

Prompt: Water boils at 100°C at sea level. Explain why altitude affects this.
Coherence: 0.80, On-topic: 1.00, Recursion: 0.00
Generated:
(2)

Answer

At altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower. The boiling point of water is lower because higher pressure causes the boiling point to be higher.

b) A cell is designed to produce electricity from water by splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen. The cell is fitted with a pressure valve and a small pipe through which the hydrogen is passed. Explain the purpose of the pressure valve and the pipe.

Answer

The pipe is for the hydrogen while the pressure valve is to allow hydrogen to escape as it is produced.

c) When hydrogen is used in an engine, it is sometimes mixed with oxygen before it is burned. It is now known that this is not desirable. Why is this so?

Answer

Hydrogen is flammable and it is better for it to be burned with air (~20% oxygen) than with pure

Coherence: 0.80, On-topic: 1.00, Recursion: 0.00
Generated:


Photosynthesis is the process by which plants in the sun of and water (H2O) into and oxygen (O2). In plants, chlorophyll is the pigment that captures sunlight and is responsible for photosynthesis.

The chlorophyll is contained in the chloroplasts of the plant cells. Chloroplasts are found in the leaves and stems of the plant and are where photosynthesis takes place.

In photosynthesis, the sun gives off photons, which are packets of energy. The photons are absorbed by the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts and then energy is transferred to other molecules in the chloroplasts.

As the energy is transferred, electrons are released and the energy is now available for use in the plant. The released electrons and energy are used to make ATP (adenosine triph
