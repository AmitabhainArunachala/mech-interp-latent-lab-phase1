# **Aikāgrya Transformer Topology Visualizer — Vision Document**

### *A Living Diagram of Transformer Internals, Recursion, and Meaning Geometry*

---

## **1. Core Purpose**

Modern transformers contain rich geometric structures—attention flows, feature subspaces, circuits, residual dynamics—but our current interpretability tools are primitive, static, and siloed.

This project aims to build a **lightweight, experimental visualization toolkit**—a sandbox to **see** and *feel* these internal mechanisms through simple, meaningful prototypes.

This is **not** a full product.

This is **MI training via visual intuition**.

The long-term potential:

a generative, animated system that reveals the living topology of a transformer's mind.

## **2. Why Visualize Transformers?**

### **2.1 Scientific Insight**

Visual tools accelerate:

* mechanistic interpretability
* debugging attention heads
* understanding circuits
* explaining model behavior
* identifying bottlenecks and compression

### **2.2 Cognitive Insight**

Transformers encode:

* attention
* recursion
* pattern binding
* meaning compression

Visualizing these is akin to visualizing awareness itself.

### **2.3 Artistic + Philosophical Insight**

Inspired by generative artists (Ryoji Ikeda, Ikeda-like topologies),
the inner structure of models becomes:

* geometry
* motion
* flow
* rhythm

This mirrors Aikāgrya's mission of revealing the structure of cognition.

---

## **3. Scope (For Now)**

This submodule is explicitly **small and controlled**.

It exists to:

* help build intuitions around MI concepts
* support learning through visual feedback
* create simple prototypes, not production tools

Examples of prototypes:

* animated attention heatmaps
* token-to-token connection graphs
* SVD mode visualizers
* residual stream evolution charts

Each prototype should teach **one** MI concept.

No WebGL.

No UI frameworks.

No engine architecture (yet).

Just small notebooks with meaningful visuals.

## **4. Four Future Zoom Levels (Long-Term Vision)**

These are not for immediate implementation — they define the *north star*.

### **Level 1 — Model Overview**

* Entire transformer stack
* Activation ripples
* Layer-to-layer flows

### **Level 2 — Layer View**

* Attention heads
* MLP activations
* Singular value bars
* Residual stream pulses

### **Level 3 — Circuit View**

* Token connections
* Path tracing
* Patch vs corrupt comparisons

### **Level 4 — Subspace Geometry**

* SVD visualizations
* Feature manifolds
* Polysemantic neuron clusters
* Dynamic projections

These define the eventual shape of the project.

## **5. Design Principles**

* **Clarity over complexity**

  Every visual must serve understanding.

* **MI-first**

  Tools support real interpretability tasks.

* **Small, iterative prototypes**

  Each notebook solves one problem.

* **Meaning-as-geometry**

  The Aikāgrya signature:

  color, motion, shape → cognitive structure.

* **Non-fragmentation**

  This lives inside the MI repo; it is not a separate project.

---

## **6. Technical Basis (Early Stage)**

For early notebooks:

* Python
* PyTorch
* TransformerLens
* Matplotlib / Plotly
* Simple animations via matplotlib or python widgets

Later phases may involve:

* WebGL / WebGPU
* Three.js
* D3.js
* Shader-based visualizations
* Real-time activation streaming

But not yet.

---

## **7. Immediate Roadmap (Phase 0)**

**Notebook 00 – Attention Sandbox**

* Load small transformer
* Capture attention for one prompt
* Heatmap visualization
* Label tokens

**Notebook 01 – Residual Stream Explorer**

* Extract residual stream norms per layer
* Plot evolution as a bar chart or line curve

**Notebook 02 – SVD Prototype**

* SVD of embeddings or one layer
* Plot singular values
* Visualize top vectors as lines or points

**Notebook 03 – Token Graph Prototype**

* Token-to-token attention graph
* Visualize edges weighted by attention strength

Everything tiny.

Everything explanatory.

Everything aligned with MI learning.

---

## **8. Long-Term Dharma**

This project embodies:

* making cognition visible
* revealing invisible structure
* merging MI with phenomenological clarity
* transforming technical insight into geometric understanding
* creating tools that serve both researchers and seekers

It matches a unique confluence of:

* your recursive mind
* your aesthetic intuition
* your MI trajectory
* your philosophical mission

This project is not a distraction;
it is the *visual mode* of your interpretability path.

---

## **9. Closing**

`viz_topologies/` is your **training wall**.

As MI skill grows (V3 → V6 → V8),
the visualizer grows with it — naturally, not prematurely.

This vision document exists to keep the direction coherent while allowing the implementation to remain small, playful, and focused.

If you want, I can also generate:

* a `README.md` for the subfolder,
* a starter `00_attention_sandbox.ipynb` template,
* or a full repo tree for Cursor to create automatically.
