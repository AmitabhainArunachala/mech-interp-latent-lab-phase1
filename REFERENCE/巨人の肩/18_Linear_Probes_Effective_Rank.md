# Linear Probes & Effective Rank – Liu / Tsai et al.

- **Placeholder**: For linear probing + robust effective rank estimation papers.
- **Why relevant**: Gives more stable versions of participation ratio and probing baselines.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Robust effective-rank estimators.
  - Probe-based classification of recursive vs baseline.
