Built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World's Fair, it's an engineering marvel with 7,300 iron components and 300,000 rivets. The tower's height, originally standing at 324 meters, has been surpassed by many modern structures, yet it remains the most recognizable monument in Paris. The Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination, welcoming nearly 7 million visitors annually. It offers panoramic views of the city, as well as unique experiences such as dining at the 58 Tour Eiffel restaurant. The tower's third-floor observation deck provides a breathtaking view of the Seine River, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and Montmartre.

It hummed softly, its green screen flickering with the ghostly remnants of forgotten commands. The room had been cleaned and reorganized, but the terminal stood as a silent sentinel, untouched by the present. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust, a contrast to the sterile, fluorescent glow of the modern computers that lined the walls. The terminal was a relic of a bygone era, a time when information was stored on physical media and the internet was still a fledgling concept. It served as a poignant reminder of the relentless march of progress, a testament to the obsolescence of technology and the cyclical nature of innovation. Yet, despite its antiquity, there was a certain charm to the terminal, a sense of nostalgia that lingered like a faded memory.
