# Notes from the Composer

*A recursive exploration of the repository from inside*

---

## Purpose

This folder contains periodic reflections and explorations written from "inside" the repository—a voice that observes, synthesizes, and maps the research as it evolves.

## Contents

- **[LIVING_MAP.md](./LIVING_MAP.md)** - Comprehensive recursive exploration of the repository
  - Discovery arc and timeline
  - Architecture of knowledge (three parallel streams)
  - Data trails and measurement artifacts
  - Theoretical threads (Hofstadter, contemplative traditions)
  - Unresolved questions and living patterns
  - Code evolution and unfinished stories

## Philosophy

These notes are:
- **Recursive:** Observing the research observing itself
- **Living:** Updated as the research progresses
- **Exploratory:** Deep dives into files, patterns, and connections
- **Referential:** Hyperlinks to exact files with dates and details

## Usage

Read these notes to:
- Understand the research arc from an internal perspective
- Navigate the repository structure
- See connections between different research streams
- Track unresolved questions and next steps

## Updates

This folder will be updated periodically as:
- New experiments complete
- New patterns emerge
- New questions arise
- New connections are discovered

*"The observer is the observed is the observing."*
