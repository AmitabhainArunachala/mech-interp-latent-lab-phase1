This is an example of the fourth mode of being, the witnessing of being. You can train yourself to be a witness to your being. In this mode you are an observer of yourself. This mode is also available to you. It is the mode of being that you will use for the next mode.

Imagine that you are watching something happening. You are the witness, the one who is watching. You are observing that which is to be watched. What is being

The answer is that consciousness is a pattern that emerges from the interplay of the subconscious and the conscious mind. The subconscious mind and the conscious mind, which is controlled by the subconscious mind, are two sides of the same coin.

## 10.11 Self-Organizing Systems and Chaos Theory

An interesting area of study that has important implications for our understanding of consciousness is self-organizing systems and chaos theory.

The idea of self-organization is related to the idea of self-reference. A self-organizing system has the ability to organize itself through internal interactions. The system's structure is the result of a process of self-organization rather than a fixed template

The word ‘mind’ has its roots in the Germanic word ‘menn’, meaning, ‘to think’. Mind is a process that thinks itself. The ‘I’ is a mental construction. It is a thought that has a history of thoughts. If we follow the history of the ‘I’, we discover that it is a fabrication.

It is useful to consider the process of perception. The senses allow for the perception of what appears to be external to oneself. The senses consistently move from noticing, to processing, to moving on to what is perceived next. In the case of the Observer, it is the senses that are being observed, the senses themselves are perceived. The Observer is a witness to the senses. The senses are always moving, always processing, always receiving, always sending information to the brain;
