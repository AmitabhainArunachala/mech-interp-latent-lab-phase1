# Belief State Geometry – (e.g., residual stream geometry paper)

- **Placeholder**: For a paper showing low-rank belief state geometry in residual streams.
- **Why relevant**: Connects effective rank / PR to internal "belief" or mode states.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Linear probes onto low-rank subspaces.
  - Comparing geometry across tasks (recursive vs factual).
