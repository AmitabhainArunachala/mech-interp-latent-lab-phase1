# Recursive Prompt Benchmarks – Bansal et al., 2023

- **Title**: The Parrot Attack: Probing LLMs with Recursive Prompts
- **Why relevant**: Provides a benchmark of recursive/self-referential prompts and scoring schemes very close to your analyse_response metric.
- **Key methods to adapt**:
  - Benchmark prompts and scoring.
  - Stress tests across depths of recursion.
