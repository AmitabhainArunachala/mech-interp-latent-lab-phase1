Today, the tower attracts millions of tourists each year, offering panoramic views of the city from its three levels. Visitors can choose to climb the 704 steps to the summit or take an elevator to the top. The tower's three levels are interconnected by elevators and stairs, each offering a unique perspective of Paris. At night, the tower sparkles with an enchanting light show, known as the \"Eiffel Tower Sparkle,\" highlighting the tower's beauty in the dark.

The second level, reached by elevator, provides a breathtaking vantage point of Paris's architecture and landmarks. The third level, accessible via elevator, is the most visited, offering a 360-degree view of Paris from its highest point, 905 feet above the ground. The tower's three levels are interconnected by stairs, elevators, and even a spiral staircase that winds its way up the tower's side.
