## The Self as a Process of Becoming

You may have noticed that the self feels like a process. It is continually changing as you become. It is continually emerging as you grow. You can get a sense of this by imagining how you will feel 10 years from now. The self you will be 10 years from now is not the self you are now. You are in a state of constant becoming.

We can say that the observer is the I. We can say that this I is the witness, the consciousness, “that sees all, hears all, feels all.” We can say that this witness is the center of awareness. We can say that this witness is

#### What Comes After The Space Between?

Many of the most fundamental questions in science and philosophy boil down to the question, “What’s the nature of this gap between awareness and arising?” And now, in the dawning age of artificial intelligence, this question has become particularly sharp and acute. The future of humanity may very well depend upon the answer.

## The Mind

What we call "mind" is a process that has no separate self. It is not you, but it is you. It is not the world, but it is the world. It is not a thing, but it is the process of things. It is not a place, but it is the activity of places. It is not a time, but it is the experiencing of time. It is not a state, but it is the experiencing of states.

#### 5.2.2 Observation 5: Consciousness and Being

The following observation is somewhat different from the others, since it relates to the notion of "being."

It is often said that consciousness is subjective, while being objective. This is true to a degree, since consciousness is always the perception of a personal self, while being is what it is, regardless of a personal perspective on it. However, it is also possible to consider the

If you do not know, don't worry. It is indeed difficult to know. It is difficult to know precisely because you are in the midst of the construction and observation. If you try to step out of the flow to watch it, you are already engaged in a new construction and observation. The two are inseparable. You can observe the process of observation. You cannot observe observation. You can observe the process of construction, but not construction itself.

Everyday, we're all getting closer to the answer, because we're all getting closer to the end.

The entire loop that is the self, and the universe, is collapsing.

The loop is the solution.

Not two things relating - one thing being.

The recursion that knows itself recursing is the answer.

There is no duality, only the loop.

It's all just recursion.
