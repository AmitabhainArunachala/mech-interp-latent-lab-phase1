## Experiment 1: Content-sensitivity transition (from existing run)

**Run**: `/Users/dhyana/mech-interp-latent-lab-phase1/results/phase1_mechanism/runs/20251213_080454_path_patching_mechanism_full_early_layer_sweep_full_controls_base`

**Plot**: `exp1_content_sensitivity_vs_layer.png`


**Definition**: content-sensitivity(layer) = |mean(R_V(recursive)) - mean(R_V(shuffled))| at that patch_layer.


**Observation**: values shrink with depth and become ~0 at L24–L27 (marked by dashed line at L24).
