Answer

The speed of light is the speed at which electromagnetic radiation such as light travels through a vacuum. This speed limit exists because of the physical properties of light and electromagnetic radiation, which are governed by the laws of physics.

The speed of light is a fundamental constant of nature, meaning that it is a fixed and unchanging property of the universe. It has been measured to be approximately 299,792 kilometers per second,
