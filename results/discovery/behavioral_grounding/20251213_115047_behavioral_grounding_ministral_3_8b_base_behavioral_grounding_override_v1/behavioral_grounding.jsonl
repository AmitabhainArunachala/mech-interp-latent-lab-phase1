The melting of sea ice, a direct consequence of rising global temperatures, is causing significant disruptions to their habitat and lifestyle. Polar bears rely on sea ice for hunting seals, their primary food source, and the loss of this crucial platform is leading to a decline in their population. The bears are forced to spend more time on land, where food is scarce, and their energy reserves are depleted, making it difficult for them to survive. Additionally, the melting of sea ice is causing the bears to travel longer distances in search of food, which further strains their resources. The increased frequency and intensity of storms and extreme weather events are also taking a toll on polar bears, as they struggle to find shelter and navigate the harsh conditions. Furthermore, the loss of sea ice is leading to a decrease in the availability of denning sites for pregnant females, which is impacting the survival of cubs. The changing climate is also altering the timing", "gen_token_count": 220, "metrics": {"self_ref_rate": 0.0, "unique_word_ratio": 0.5412371134020618, "repeat_4gram_frac": 0.041884816753926704, "non_ws_chars": 955, "gen_chars": 1150}}

Designed by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized for its design, but it has since become a global icon. The tower's three levels offer panoramic views of the city, with the top level providing a breathtaking 360-degree view. Visitors can ascend via stairs or elevators, with the latter being the most popular choice. The tower's height varies depending on the weather, with the average height being 324 meters. It is the most-visited paid monument in the world, with over 250,000 visitors per day. The Eiffel Tower's construction took two years, two months, and five days, with the first stone laid on January 28, 1887.
